		it already exists or is a new module. If the module is new, then __name__
		is set the first argument to the method, __loader__ is set to self, and

		before it is passed to the decorated function (if self.is_package() does
		not work for the module it will be set post-load).
		
		If an exception is raised and the decorator created the module it is
		subsequently removed from sys.modules.
		
		The decorator assumes that the decorated function takes the module name as
		the second argument.

	/**
		Function that measures Binary Cross Entropy between target and input
		logits.
		
		See :class:`~torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` for details.
		
		Args:
		    input: Tensor of arbitrary shape as unnormalized scores (often referred to as logits).
		    target: Tensor of the same shape as input with values between 0 and 1
		    weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight
		        if provided it's repeated to match input tensor shape
		    size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
		        the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
		        some losses, there multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
		        is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
		        when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
		    reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
		        losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
		        on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
		        batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
		    reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
		        ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
		        ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
		        elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
		        and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
		        specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
		    pos_weight (Tensor, optional): a weight of positive examples.
		            Must be a vector with length equal to the number of classes.
		
		Examples::
		
		     >>> input = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
		     >>> target = torch.empty(3).random_(2)
		     >>> loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(input, target)
		     >>> loss.backward()

		Given a list of values (possibly containing numbers), returns a list where each

		    values are scalars, then they are upcasted to scalar Tensors.
		
		Args:

		Raises:
		    ValueError: if any of the values is not a `numbers.Number` instance,

		dot(a, b, out=None)
		
		Dot product of two arrays.
		
		For 2-D arrays it is equivalent to matrix multiplication, and for 1-D
		arrays to inner product of vectors (without complex conjugation). For
		N dimensions it is a sum product over the last axis of `a` and
		the second-to-last of `b`::
		
		    dot(a, b)[i,j,k,m] = sum(a[i,j,:] * b[k,:,m])
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    First argument.
		b : array_like
		    Second argument.
		out : ndarray, optional
		    Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned
		    if it was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be
		    C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned
		    for `dot(a,b)`. This is a performance feature. Therefore, if these
		    conditions are not met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting
		    to be flexible.
		
		Returns
		-------
		output : ndarray
		    Returns the dot product of `a` and `b`.  If `a` and `b` are both
		    scalars or both 1-D arrays then a scalar is returned; otherwise
		    an array is returned.
		    If `out` is given, then it is returned.
		
		Raises
		------
		ValueError
		    If the last dimension of `a` is not the same size as
		    the second-to-last dimension of `b`.
		
		See Also
		--------
		vdot : Complex-conjugating dot product.
		tensordot : Sum products over arbitrary axes.
		einsum : Einstein summation convention.
		matmul : '@' operator as method with out parameter.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> np.dot(3, 4)
		12
		
		Neither argument is complex-conjugated:
		
		>>> np.dot([2j, 3j], [2j, 3j])
		(-13+0j)
		
		For 2-D arrays it is the matrix product:
		
		>>> a = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
		>>> b = [[4, 1], [2, 2]]
		>>> np.dot(a, b)
		array([[4, 1],

		>>> a = np.arange(3*4*5*6).reshape((3,4,5,6))
		>>> b = np.arange(3*4*5*6)[::-1].reshape((5,4,6,3))
		>>> np.dot(a, b)[2,3,2,1,2,2]

		exp(x[, out])
		
		Calculate the exponential of all elements in the input array.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Input values.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray
		    Output array, element-wise exponential of `x`.
		
		See Also
		--------
		expm1 : Calculate ``exp(x) - 1`` for all elements in the array.
		exp2  : Calculate ``2**x`` for all elements in the array.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The irrational number ``e`` is also known as Euler's number.  It is
		approximately 2.718281, and is the base of the natural logarithm,
		``ln`` (this means that, if :math:`x = \ln y = \log_e y`,
		then :math:`e^x = y`. For real input, ``exp(x)`` is always positive.
		
		For complex arguments, ``x = a + ib``, we can write
		:math:`e^x = e^a e^{ib}`.  The first term, :math:`e^a`, is already
		known (it is the real argument, described above).  The second term,
		:math:`e^{ib}`, is :math:`\cos b + i \sin b`, a function with
		magnitude 1 and a periodic phase.

	/**
		multivariate_normal(mean, cov[, size])
		
		Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.
		
		The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
		generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
		dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and
		covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean
		(average or "center") and variance (standard deviation, or "width,"
		squared) of the one-dimensional normal distribution.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		mean : 1-D array_like, of length N
		    Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
		cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)
		    Covariance matrix of the distribution. It must be symmetric and
		    positive-semidefinite for proper sampling.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are
		    generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
		    each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
		    If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray
		    The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
		    the shape is ``(N,)``.
		
		    In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
		    value drawn from the distribution.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
		location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
		analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
		univariate normal distribution.
		
		Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
		From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
		samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
		element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
		The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
		"spread").
		
		Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
		approximations include:
		
		  - Spherical covariance (*cov* is a multiple of the identity matrix)
		  - Diagonal covariance (*cov* has non-negative elements, and only on
		    the diagonal)
		
		This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
		generated data-points:
		
		>>> mean = [0, 0]
		>>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 100]]  # diagonal covariance
		
		Diagonal covariance means that points are oriented along x or y-axis:
		
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> x, y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 5000).T
		>>> plt.plot(x, y, 'x')
		>>> plt.axis('equal')
		>>> plt.show()
		
		Note that the covariance matrix must be positive semidefinite (a.k.a.
		nonnegative-definite). Otherwise, the behavior of this method is
		undefined and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

		randint(low, high=None, size=None, dtype='l')
		
		Return random integers from `low` (inclusive) to `high` (exclusive).
		
		Return random integers from the "discrete uniform" distribution of

		`high` is None (the default), then results are from [0, `low`).
		
		Parameters
		----------
		low : int
		    Lowest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution (unless
		    ``high=None``, in which case this parameter is the *highest* such
		    integer).
		high : int, optional
		    If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn
		    from the distribution (see above for behavior if ``high=None``).
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
		    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
		    single value is returned.
		dtype : dtype, optional
		    Desired dtype of the result. All dtypes are determined by their
		    name, i.e., 'int64', 'int', etc, so byteorder is not available
		    and a specific precision may have different C types depending
		    on the platform. The default value is 'np.int'.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.11.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : int or ndarray of ints
		    `size`-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate
		    distribution, or a single such random int if `size` not provided.
		
		See Also
		--------
		random.random_integers : similar to `randint`, only for the closed
		    interval [`low`, `high`], and 1 is the lowest value if `high` is

	/**
		Return a contiguous flattened array.
		
		A 1-D array, containing the elements of the input, is returned.  A copy is
		made only if needed.
		
		As of NumPy 1.10, the returned array will have the same type as the input
		array. (for example, a masked array will be returned for a masked array
		input)
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array.  The elements in `a` are read in the order specified by
		    `order`, and packed as a 1-D array.
		order : {'C','F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
		
		    The elements of `a` are read using this index order. 'C' means
		    to index the elements in row-major, C-style order,
		    with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
		    axis index changing slowest.  'F' means to index the elements
		    in column-major, Fortran-style order, with the
		    first index changing fastest, and the last index changing
		    slowest. Note that the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of
		    the memory layout of the underlying array, and only refer to
		    the order of axis indexing.  'A' means to read the elements in
		    Fortran-like index order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in
		    memory, C-like order otherwise.  'K' means to read the
		    elements in the order they occur in memory, except for
		    reversing the data when strides are negative.  By default, 'C'
		    index order is used.
		
		Returns
		-------
		y : array_like
		    If `a` is a matrix, y is a 1-D ndarray, otherwise y is an array of
		    the same subtype as `a`. The shape of the returned array is
		    ``(a.size,)``. Matrices are special cased for backward
		    compatibility.
		
		See Also
		--------
		ndarray.flat : 1-D iterator over an array.
		ndarray.flatten : 1-D array copy of the elements of an array
		                  in row-major order.
		ndarray.reshape : Change the shape of an array without changing its data.
		
		Notes
		-----
		In row-major, C-style order, in two dimensions, the row index
		varies the slowest, and the column index the quickest.  This can
		be generalized to multiple dimensions, where row-major order
		implies that the index along the first axis varies slowest, and
		the index along the last quickest.  The opposite holds for
		column-major, Fortran-style index ordering.
		
		When a view is desired in as many cases as possible, ``arr.reshape(-1)``
		may be preferable.
		
		Examples
		--------
		It is equivalent to ``reshape(-1, order=order)``.
		
		>>> x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
		>>> print(np.ravel(x))
		[1 2 3 4 5 6]
		
		>>> print(x.reshape(-1))
		[1 2 3 4 5 6]
		
		>>> print(np.ravel(x, order='F'))
		[1 4 2 5 3 6]
		
		When ``order`` is 'A', it will preserve the array's 'C' or 'F' ordering:
		
		>>> print(np.ravel(x.T))
		[1 4 2 5 3 6]
		>>> print(np.ravel(x.T, order='A'))
		[1 2 3 4 5 6]
		
		When ``order`` is 'K', it will preserve orderings that are neither 'C'
		nor 'F', but won't reverse axes:
		
		>>> a = np.arange(3)[::-1]; a
		array([2, 1, 0])
		>>> a.ravel(order='C')
		array([2, 1, 0])
		>>> a.ravel(order='K')

		Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Array to be reshaped.
		newshape : int or tuple of ints
		    The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
		    an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
		    One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is inferred
		    from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
		order : {'C', 'F', 'A'}, optional
		    Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the elements
		    into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C' means to
		    read / write the elements using C-like index order, with the last axis
		    index changing fastest, back to the first axis index changing slowest.
		    'F' means to read / write the elements using Fortran-like index order,
		    with the first index changing fastest, and the last index changing
		    slowest.
		    Note that the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of the memory layout
		    of the underlying array, and only refer to the order of indexing.  'A'
		    means to read / write the elements in Fortran-like index order if `a`
		    is Fortran *contiguous* in memory, C-like order otherwise.
		
		Returns
		-------
		reshaped_array : ndarray
		    This will be a new view object if possible; otherwise, it will
		    be a copy.  Note there is no guarantee of the *memory layout* (C- or
		    Fortran- contiguous) of the returned array.
		
		See Also
		--------
		ndarray.reshape : Equivalent method.
		
		Notes
		-----
		It is not always possible to change the shape of an array without
		copying the data. If you want an error to be raise if the data is copied,
		you should assign the new shape to the shape attribute of the array::
		
		 >>> a = np.zeros((10, 2))
		 # A transpose make the array non-contiguous
		 >>> b = a.T
		 # Taking a view makes it possible to modify the shape without modifying
		 # the initial object.
		 >>> c = b.view()
		 >>> c.shape = (20)
		 AttributeError: incompatible shape for a non-contiguous array
		
		The `order` keyword gives the index ordering both for *fetching* the values
		from `a`, and then *placing* the values into the output array.
		For example, let's say you have an array:
		
		>>> a = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
		>>> a
		array([[0, 1],
		       [2, 3],
		       [4, 5]])
		
		You can think of reshaping as first raveling the array (using the given
		index order), then inserting the elements from the raveled array into the
		new array using the same kind of index ordering as was used for the
		raveling.
		
		>>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3)) # C-like index ordering
		array([[0, 1, 2],
		       [3, 4, 5]])
		>>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a), (2, 3)) # equivalent to C ravel then C reshape

		real "interval" [`-inf`, 0), and is continuous from above on it.
		A branch cut is a curve in the complex plane across which a given
		complex function fails to be continuous.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> np.sqrt([1,4,9])
		array([ 1.,  2.,  3.])
		
		>>> np.sqrt([4, -1, -3+4J])
		array([ 2.+0.j,  0.+1.j,  1.+2.j])
		
		>>> np.sqrt([4, -1, numpy.inf])
		array([  2.,  NaN,  Inf])

	/**
		Remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input data.
		axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
		    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
		
		    Selects a subset of the single-dimensional entries in the
		    shape. If an axis is selected with shape entry greater than
		    one, an error is raised.
		
		Returns
		-------
		squeezed : ndarray
		    The input array, but with all or a subset of the
		    dimensions of length 1 removed. This is always `a` itself
		    or a view into `a`.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> x = np.array([[[0], [1], [2]]])
		>>> x.shape
		(1, 3, 1)
		>>> np.squeeze(x).shape
		(3,)
		>>> np.squeeze(x, axis=(2,)).shape

	/**
		Sum of array elements over a given axis.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Elements to sum.
		axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Axis or axes along which a sum is performed.  The default,
		    axis=None, will sum all of the elements of the input array.  If
		    axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
		
		    If axis is a tuple of ints, a sum is performed on all of the axes
		    specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as
		    before.
		dtype : dtype, optional
		    The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
		    elements are summed.  The dtype of `a` is used by default unless `a`
		    has an integer dtype of less precision than the default platform
		    integer.  In that case, if `a` is signed then the platform integer
		    is used while if `a` is unsigned then an unsigned integer of the
		    same precision as the platform integer is used.
		out : ndarray, optional
		    Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
		    the same shape as the expected output, but the type of the output
		    values will be cast if necessary.
		keepdims : bool, optional
		    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
		    in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
		    the result will broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.
		
		    If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
		    passed through to the `sum` method of sub-classes of
		    `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
		    sub-classes `sum` method does not implement `keepdims` any
		    exceptions will be raised.
		
		Returns
		-------
		sum_along_axis : ndarray
		    An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified
		    axis removed.   If `a` is a 0-d array, or if `axis` is None, a scalar
		    is returned.  If an output array is specified, a reference to
		    `out` is returned.

		--------
		ndarray.sum : Equivalent method.
		
		cumsum : Cumulative sum of array elements.
		
		trapz : Integration of array values using the composite trapezoidal rule.
		
		mean, average
		
		Notes
		-----
		Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
		raised on overflow.
		
		The sum of an empty array is the neutral element 0:
		
		>>> np.sum([])
		0.0
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> np.sum([0.5, 1.5])
		2.0
		>>> np.sum([0.5, 0.7, 0.2, 1.5], dtype=np.int32)
		1
		>>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]])
		6
		>>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]], axis=0)
		array([0, 6])
		>>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]], axis=1)
		array([1, 5])
		
		If the accumulator is too small, overflow occurs:
		
		>>> np.ones(128, dtype=np.int8).sum(dtype=np.int8)
		-128

		Permute the dimensions of an array.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array.
		axes : list of ints, optional
		    By default, reverse the dimensions, otherwise permute the axes
		    according to the values given.
		
		Returns
		-------
		p : ndarray
		    `a` with its axes permuted.  A view is returned whenever
		    possible.

		Notes
		-----
		Use `transpose(a, argsort(axes))` to invert the transposition of tensors
		when using the `axes` keyword argument.
		
		Transposing a 1-D array returns an unchanged view of the original array.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> x = np.arange(4).reshape((2,2))
		>>> x
		array([[0, 1],
		       [2, 3]])
		
		>>> np.transpose(x)

	/**
		zeros(shape, dtype=float, order='C')
		
		Return a new array of given shape and type, filled with zeros.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		shape : int or sequence of ints
		    Shape of the new array, e.g., ``(2, 3)`` or ``2``.
		dtype : data-type, optional
		    The desired data-type for the array, e.g., `numpy.int8`.  Default is
		    `numpy.float64`.

		    Whether to store multidimensional data in C- or Fortran-contiguous
		    (row- or column-wise) order in memory.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray
		    Array of zeros with the given shape, dtype, and order.

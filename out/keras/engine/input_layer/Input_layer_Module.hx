		`Input()` is used to instantiate a Keras tensor.
		
		A Keras tensor is a tensor object from the underlying backend
		(Theano, TensorFlow or CNTK), which we augment with certain
		attributes that allow us to build a Keras model
		just by knowing the inputs and outputs of the model.
		
		For instance, if a, b and c are Keras tensors,
		it becomes possible to do:
		`model = Model(input=[a, b], output=c)`
		
		The added Keras attributes are:
		    `_keras_shape`: Integer shape tuple propagated
		        via Keras-side shape inference.
		    `_keras_history`: Last layer applied to the tensor.
		        the entire layer graph is retrievable from that layer,
		        recursively.
		
		# Arguments
		    shape: A shape tuple (integer), not including the batch size.
		        For instance, `shape=(32,)` indicates that the expected input
		        will be batches of 32-dimensional vectors.
		    batch_shape: A shape tuple (integer), including the batch size.
		        For instance, `batch_shape=(10, 32)` indicates that
		        the expected input will be batches of 10 32-dimensional vectors.
		        `batch_shape=(None, 32)` indicates batches of an arbitrary number
		        of 32-dimensional vectors.
		    name: An optional name string for the layer.
		        Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice).
		        It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided.
		    dtype: The data type expected by the input, as a string
		        (`float32`, `float64`, `int32`...)
		    sparse: A boolean specifying whether the placeholder
		        to be created is sparse.
		    tensor: Optional existing tensor to wrap into the `Input` layer.
		        If set, the layer will not create a placeholder tensor.
		
		# Returns
		    A tensor.
		
		# Example
		
		```python
		# this is a logistic regression in Keras
		x = Input(shape=(32,))
		y = Dense(16, activation='softmax')(x)
		model = Model(x, y)
		```

		Atrous convolution (a.k.a. convolution with holes or dilated convolution).
		
		This function is a simpler wrapper around the more general
		`tf.nn.convolution`, and exists only for backwards compatibility. You can
		use `tf.nn.convolution` to perform 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D atrous convolution.
		
		
		Computes a 2-D atrous convolution, also known as convolution with holes or
		dilated convolution, given 4-D `value` and `filters` tensors. If the `rate`
		parameter is equal to one, it performs regular 2-D convolution. If the `rate`
		parameter is greater than one, it performs convolution with holes, sampling
		the input values every `rate` pixels in the `height` and `width` dimensions.
		This is equivalent to convolving the input with a set of upsampled filters,
		produced by inserting `rate - 1` zeros between two consecutive values of the
		filters along the `height` and `width` dimensions, hence the name atrous
		convolution or convolution with holes (the French word trous means holes in
		English).
		
		More specifically:
		
		```
		output[batch, height, width, out_channel] =
		    sum_{dheight, dwidth, in_channel} (
		        filters[dheight, dwidth, in_channel, out_channel] *
		        value[batch, height + rate*dheight, width + rate*dwidth, in_channel]
		    )
		```
		
		Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control how densely to compute
		feature responses in fully convolutional networks. Used in conjunction with
		bilinear interpolation, it offers an alternative to `conv2d_transpose` in
		dense prediction tasks such as semantic image segmentation, optical flow
		computation, or depth estimation. It also allows us to effectively enlarge
		the field of view of filters without increasing the number of parameters or
		the amount of computation.
		
		For a description of atrous convolution and how it can be used for dense
		feature extraction, please see: (Chen et al., 2015). The same operation is
		investigated further in (Yu et al., 2016). Previous works that effectively
		use atrous convolution in different ways are, among others,
		(Sermanet et al., 2014) and (Giusti et al., 2013).
		Atrous convolution is also closely related to the so-called noble identities
		in multi-rate signal processing.
		
		There are many different ways to implement atrous convolution (see the refs
		above). The implementation here reduces
		
		```python
		    atrous_conv2d(value, filters, rate, padding=padding)
		```
		
		to the following three operations:
		
		```python
		    paddings = ...
		    net = space_to_batch(value, paddings, block_size=rate)
		    net = conv2d(net, filters, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="VALID")
		    crops = ...
		    net = batch_to_space(net, crops, block_size=rate)
		```
		
		Advanced usage. Note the following optimization: A sequence of `atrous_conv2d`
		operations with identical `rate` parameters, 'SAME' `padding`, and filters
		with odd heights/ widths:
		
		```python
		    net = atrous_conv2d(net, filters1, rate, padding="SAME")
		    net = atrous_conv2d(net, filters2, rate, padding="SAME")
		    ...
		    net = atrous_conv2d(net, filtersK, rate, padding="SAME")
		```
		
		can be equivalently performed cheaper in terms of computation and memory as:
		
		```python
		    pad = ...  # padding so that the input dims are multiples of rate
		    net = space_to_batch(net, paddings=pad, block_size=rate)
		    net = conv2d(net, filters1, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
		    net = conv2d(net, filters2, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
		    ...
		    net = conv2d(net, filtersK, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
		    net = batch_to_space(net, crops=pad, block_size=rate)
		```
		
		because a pair of consecutive `space_to_batch` and `batch_to_space` ops with
		the same `block_size` cancel out when their respective `paddings` and `crops`
		inputs are identical.
		
		Args:
		  value: A 4-D `Tensor` of type `float`. It needs to be in the default "NHWC"
		    format. Its shape is `[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`.
		  filters: A 4-D `Tensor` with the same type as `value` and shape
		    `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`. `filters`'
		    `in_channels` dimension must match that of `value`. Atrous convolution is
		    equivalent to standard convolution with upsampled filters with effective
		    height `filter_height + (filter_height - 1) * (rate - 1)` and effective
		    width `filter_width + (filter_width - 1) * (rate - 1)`, produced by
		    inserting `rate - 1` zeros along consecutive elements across the
		    `filters`' spatial dimensions.
		  rate: A positive int32. The stride with which we sample input values across
		    the `height` and `width` dimensions. Equivalently, the rate by which we
		    upsample the filter values by inserting zeros across the `height` and
		    `width` dimensions. In the literature, the same parameter is sometimes
		    called `input stride` or `dilation`.
		  padding: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See
		    [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn#notes_on_padding_2)
		    for more information.
		  name: Optional name for the returned tensor.
		
		Returns:
		  A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`.
		  Output shape with `'VALID'` padding is:
		
		      [batch, height - 2 * (filter_width - 1),
		       width - 2 * (filter_height - 1), out_channels].
		
		  Output shape with `'SAME'` padding is:
		
		      [batch, height, width, out_channels].
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If input/output depth does not match `filters`' shape, or if
		    padding is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.

		    Required if initial_states are not provided or RNN states have a
		    heterogeneous dtype.
		  parallel_iterations: (Default: 32).  The number of iterations to run in
		    parallel.  Those operations which do not have any temporal dependency and
		    can be run in parallel, will be.  This parameter trades off time for
		    space.  Values >> 1 use more memory but take less time, while smaller
		    values use less memory but computations take longer.
		  swap_memory: Transparently swap the tensors produced in forward inference
		    but needed for back prop from GPU to CPU.  This allows training RNNs which
		    would typically not fit on a single GPU, with very minimal (or no)
		    performance penalty.
		  time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` Tensors. If true,
		    these `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size, depth]`. If false,
		    these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time, depth]`. Using
		    `time_major = True` is a bit more efficient because it avoids transposes
		    at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation.  However, most TensorFlow
		    data is batch-major, so by default this function accepts input and emits
		    output in batch-major form.
		  scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to
		    "bidirectional_rnn"
		
		Returns:
		  A tuple (outputs, output_states) where:
		    outputs: A tuple (output_fw, output_bw) containing the forward and
		      the backward rnn output `Tensor`.
		      If time_major == False (default),
		        output_fw will be a `Tensor` shaped:
		        `[batch_size, max_time, cell_fw.output_size]`
		        and output_bw will be a `Tensor` shaped:
		        `[batch_size, max_time, cell_bw.output_size]`.
		      If time_major == True,
		        output_fw will be a `Tensor` shaped:
		        `[max_time, batch_size, cell_fw.output_size]`
		        and output_bw will be a `Tensor` shaped:
		        `[max_time, batch_size, cell_bw.output_size]`.
		      It returns a tuple instead of a single concatenated `Tensor`, unlike
		      in the `bidirectional_rnn`. If the concatenated one is preferred,
		      the forward and backward outputs can be concatenated as
		      `tf.concat(outputs, 2)`.
		    output_states: A tuple (output_state_fw, output_state_bw) containing
		      the forward and the backward final states of bidirectional rnn.

		Computes sums of N-D convolutions (actually cross-correlation).
		
		This also supports either output striding via the optional `strides` parameter
		or atrous convolution (also known as convolution with holes or dilated
		convolution, based on the French word "trous" meaning holes in English) via
		the optional `dilation_rate` parameter.  Currently, however, output striding
		is not supported for atrous convolutions.
		
		Specifically, in the case that `data_format` does not start with "NC", given
		a rank (N+2) `input` Tensor of shape
		
		  [num_batches,
		   input_spatial_shape[0],
		   ...,
		   input_spatial_shape[N-1],
		   num_input_channels],
		
		a rank (N+2) `filter` Tensor of shape
		
		  [spatial_filter_shape[0],
		   ...,
		   spatial_filter_shape[N-1],
		   num_input_channels,
		   num_output_channels],
		
		an optional `dilation_rate` tensor of shape [N] (defaulting to [1]*N)
		specifying the filter upsampling/input downsampling rate, and an optional list
		of N `strides` (defaulting [1]*N), this computes for each N-D spatial output
		position (x[0], ..., x[N-1]):
		
		```
		  output[b, x[0], ..., x[N-1], k] =
		      sum_{z[0], ..., z[N-1], q}
		          filter[z[0], ..., z[N-1], q, k] *
		          padded_input[b,
		                       x[0]*strides[0] + dilation_rate[0]*z[0],
		                       ...,
		                       x[N-1]*strides[N-1] + dilation_rate[N-1]*z[N-1],
		                       q]
		```
		where b is the index into the batch, k is the output channel number, q is the
		input channel number, and z is the N-D spatial offset within the filter. Here,
		`padded_input` is obtained by zero padding the input using an effective
		spatial filter shape of `(spatial_filter_shape-1) * dilation_rate + 1` and
		output striding `strides`.
		
		In the case that `data_format` does start with `"NC"`, the `input` and output
		(but not the `filter`) are simply transposed as follows:
		
		  convolution(input, data_format, **kwargs) =
		    tf.transpose(convolution(tf.transpose(input, [0] + range(2,N+2) + [1]),
		                             **kwargs),
		                 [0, N+1] + range(1, N+1))
		
		It is required that 1 <= N <= 3.
		
		Args:
		  input: An (N+2)-D `Tensor` of type `T`, of shape
		    `[batch_size] + input_spatial_shape + [in_channels]` if data_format does
		    not start with "NC" (default), or
		    `[batch_size, in_channels] + input_spatial_shape` if data_format starts
		    with "NC".
		  filter: An (N+2)-D `Tensor` with the same type as `input` and shape
		    `spatial_filter_shape + [in_channels, out_channels]`.
		  padding: A string, either `"VALID"` or `"SAME"`. The padding algorithm.
		    `"valid"` means no padding. `"same"` results in padding evenly to
		    the left/right or up/down of the input such that output has the same
		    height/width dimension as the input when the strides are 1. See
		    [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn#notes_on_padding_2)
		    for more information.
		  strides: Optional.  Sequence of N ints >= 1.  Specifies the output stride.
		    Defaults to [1]*N.  If any value of strides is > 1, then all values of
		    dilation_rate must be 1.
		  dilation_rate: Optional.  Sequence of N ints >= 1.  Specifies the filter
		    upsampling/input downsampling rate.  In the literature, the same parameter
		    is sometimes called `input stride` or `dilation`.  The effective filter
		    size used for the convolution will be `spatial_filter_shape +
		    (spatial_filter_shape - 1) * (rate - 1)`, obtained by inserting
		    (dilation_rate[i]-1) zeros between consecutive elements of the original
		    filter in each spatial dimension i.  If any value of dilation_rate is > 1,
		    then all values of strides must be 1.
		  name: Optional name for the returned tensor.
		  data_format: A string or None.  Specifies whether the channel dimension of
		    the `input` and output is the last dimension (default, or if `data_format`
		    does not start with "NC"), or the second dimension (if `data_format`
		    starts with "NC").  For N=1, the valid values are "NWC" (default) and
		    "NCW".  For N=2, the valid values are "NHWC" (default) and "NCHW".
		    For N=3, the valid values are "NDHWC" (default) and "NCDHW".
		
		Returns:
		  A `Tensor` with the same type as `input` of shape
		
		      `[batch_size] + output_spatial_shape + [out_channels]`
		
		  if data_format is None or does not start with "NC", or
		
		      `[batch_size, out_channels] + output_spatial_shape`
		
		  if data_format starts with "NC",

	/**
		Computes the CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) Loss.
		
		This op implements the CTC loss as presented in (Graves et al., 2006).
		
		Input requirements:
		
		```
		sequence_length(b) <= time for all b
		
		max(labels.indices(labels.indices[:, 1] == b, 2))
		  <= sequence_length(b) for all b.
		```
		
		Notes:
		
		This class performs the softmax operation for you, so inputs should
		be e.g. linear projections of outputs by an LSTM.
		
		The `inputs` Tensor's innermost dimension size, `num_classes`, represents
		`num_labels + 1` classes, where num_labels is the number of true labels, and
		the largest value `(num_classes - 1)` is reserved for the blank label.
		
		For example, for a vocabulary containing 3 labels `[a, b, c]`,
		`num_classes = 4` and the labels indexing is `{a: 0, b: 1, c: 2, blank: 3}`.
		
		Regarding the arguments `preprocess_collapse_repeated` and
		`ctc_merge_repeated`:
		
		If `preprocess_collapse_repeated` is True, then a preprocessing step runs
		before loss calculation, wherein repeated labels passed to the loss
		are merged into single labels.  This is useful if the training labels come
		from, e.g., forced alignments and therefore have unnecessary repetitions.
		
		If `ctc_merge_repeated` is set False, then deep within the CTC calculation,
		repeated non-blank labels will not be merged and are interpreted
		as individual labels.  This is a simplified (non-standard) version of CTC.
		
		Here is a table of the (roughly) expected first order behavior:
		
		* `preprocess_collapse_repeated=False`, `ctc_merge_repeated=True`
		
		  Classical CTC behavior: Outputs true repeated classes with blanks in
		  between, and can also output repeated classes with no blanks in
		  between that need to be collapsed by the decoder.
		
		* `preprocess_collapse_repeated=True`, `ctc_merge_repeated=False`
		
		  Never learns to output repeated classes, as they are collapsed
		  in the input labels before training.
		
		* `preprocess_collapse_repeated=False`, `ctc_merge_repeated=False`
		
		  Outputs repeated classes with blanks in between, but generally does not
		  require the decoder to collapse/merge repeated classes.
		
		* `preprocess_collapse_repeated=True`, `ctc_merge_repeated=True`
		
		  Untested.  Very likely will not learn to output repeated classes.
		
		The `ignore_longer_outputs_than_inputs` option allows to specify the behavior
		of the CTCLoss when dealing with sequences that have longer outputs than
		inputs. If true, the CTCLoss will simply return zero gradient for those
		items, otherwise an InvalidArgument error is returned, stopping training.
		
		Args:
		  labels: An `int32` `SparseTensor`.
		    `labels.indices[i, :] == [b, t]` means `labels.values[i]` stores the id
		      for (batch b, time t). `labels.values[i]` must take on values in `[0,
		      num_labels)`. See `core/ops/ctc_ops.cc` for more details.
		  inputs: 3-D `float` `Tensor`.
		    If time_major == False, this will be a `Tensor` shaped: `[batch_size,
		      max_time, num_classes]`.
		    If time_major == True (default), this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
		      `[max_time, batch_size, num_classes]`. The logits.
		  sequence_length: 1-D `int32` vector, size `[batch_size]`. The sequence
		    lengths.
		  preprocess_collapse_repeated: Boolean.  Default: False. If True, repeated
		    labels are collapsed prior to the CTC calculation.
		  ctc_merge_repeated: Boolean.  Default: True.
		  ignore_longer_outputs_than_inputs: Boolean. Default: False. If True,
		    sequences with longer outputs than inputs will be ignored.
		  time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` Tensors. If True, these
		    `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size, num_classes]`. If False,
		    these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time, num_classes]`.
		    Using `time_major = True` (default) is a bit more efficient because it
		    avoids transposes at the beginning of the ctc_loss calculation.  However,
		    most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by this function also accepts
		    inputs in batch-major form.
		  logits: Alias for inputs.
		
		Returns:
		  A 1-D `float` `Tensor`, size `[batch]`, containing the negative log
		    probabilities.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: if labels is not a `SparseTensor`.

		Notes:
		
		- Same as the "Classic CTC" in TensorFlow 1.x's tf.compat.v1.nn.ctc_loss

		- On TPU and GPU: Only dense padded labels are supported.
		- On CPU: Caller may use SparseTensor or dense padded labels but calling with

		- Default blank label is 0 rather num_classes - 1, unless overridden by
		  blank_index.
		
		Args:

		  logits: tensor of shape [frames, batch_size, num_labels], if
		    logits_time_major == False, shape is [batch_size, frames, num_labels].
		  label_length: tensor of shape [batch_size], None if labels is SparseTensor

		DepthToSpace for tensors of type T.
		
		Rearranges data from depth into blocks of spatial data.
		This is the reverse transformation of SpaceToDepth. More specifically,
		this op outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from the `depth`
		dimension are moved in spatial blocks to the `height` and `width` dimensions.
		The attr `block_size` indicates the input block size and how the data is moved.
		
		  * Chunks of data of size `block_size * block_size` from depth are rearranged
		    into non-overlapping blocks of size `block_size x block_size`
		  * The width the output tensor is `input_depth * block_size`, whereas the
		    height is `input_height * block_size`.
		  * The Y, X coordinates within each block of the output image are determined
		    by the high order component of the input channel index.
		  * The depth of the input tensor must be divisible by
		    `block_size * block_size`.
		
		The `data_format` attr specifies the layout of the input and output tensors
		with the following options:
		  "NHWC": `[ batch, height, width, channels ]`
		  "NCHW": `[ batch, channels, height, width ]`
		  "NCHW_VECT_C":
		      `qint8 [ batch, channels / 4, height, width, 4 ]`
		
		It is useful to consider the operation as transforming a 6-D Tensor.
		e.g. for data_format = NHWC,
		     Each element in the input tensor can be specified via 6 coordinates,
		     ordered by decreasing memory layout significance as:
		     n,iY,iX,bY,bX,oC  (where n=batch index, iX, iY means X or Y coordinates
		                        within the input image, bX, bY means coordinates
		                        within the output block, oC means output channels).
		     The output would be the input transposed to the following layout:
		     n,iY,bY,iX,bX,oC
		
		This operation is useful for resizing the activations between convolutions
		(but keeping all data), e.g. instead of pooling. It is also useful for training
		purely convolutional models.
		
		For example, given an input of shape `[1, 1, 1, 4]`, data_format = "NHWC" and
		block_size = 2:
		
		```
		x = [[[[1, 2, 3, 4]]]]
		
		```
		
		This operation will output a tensor of shape `[1, 2, 2, 1]`:
		
		```
		   [[[[1], [2]],
		     [[3], [4]]]]
		```
		
		Here, the input has a batch of 1 and each batch element has shape `[1, 1, 4]`,
		the corresponding output will have 2x2 elements and will have a depth of
		1 channel (1 = `4 / (block_size * block_size)`).
		The output element shape is `[2, 2, 1]`.
		
		For an input tensor with larger depth, here of shape `[1, 1, 1, 12]`, e.g.
		
		```
		x = [[[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]]]]
		```
		
		This operation, for block size of 2, will return the following tensor of shape
		`[1, 2, 2, 3]`
		
		```
		   [[[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
		     [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]]
		
		```
		
		Similarly, for the following input of shape `[1 2 2 4]`, and a block size of 2:
		
		```
		x =  [[[[1, 2, 3, 4],
		       [5, 6, 7, 8]],
		      [[9, 10, 11, 12],
		       [13, 14, 15, 16]]]]
		```
		
		the operator will return the following tensor of shape `[1 4 4 1]`:
		
		```
		x = [[[ [1],   [2],  [5],  [6]],
		      [ [3],   [4],  [7],  [8]],
		      [ [9],  [10], [13],  [14]],
		      [ [11], [12], [15],  [16]]]]
		
		```

		  input: A `Tensor`.
		  block_size: An `int` that is `>= 2`.
		    The size of the spatial block, same as in Space2Depth.

		Depthwise 2-D convolution.
		
		Given a 4D input tensor ('NHWC' or 'NCHW' data formats)
		and a filter tensor of shape
		`[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, channel_multiplier]`
		containing `in_channels` convolutional filters of depth 1, `depthwise_conv2d`
		applies a different filter to each input channel (expanding from 1 channel

		together.  The output has `in_channels * channel_multiplier` channels.

		Must have `strides[0] = strides[3] = 1`.  For the most common case of the
		same horizontal and vertical strides, `strides = [1, stride, stride, 1]`.
		If any value in `rate` is greater than 1, we perform atrous depthwise
		convolution, in which case all values in the `strides` tensor must be equal
		to 1.

		Given an input tensor of shape `[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`
		and a filter / kernel tensor of shape
		`[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, channel_multiplier]`, containing
		`in_channels` convolutional filters of depth 1, `depthwise_conv2d` applies
		a different filter to each input channel (expanding from 1 channel to
		`channel_multiplier` channels for each), then concatenates the results
		together. Thus, the output has `in_channels * channel_multiplier` channels.
		
		```
		for k in 0..in_channels-1
		  for q in 0..channel_multiplier-1
		    output[b, i, j, k * channel_multiplier + q] =
		      sum_{di, dj} input[b, strides[1] * i + di, strides[2] * j + dj, k] *
		                        filter[di, dj, k, q]
		```
		
		Must have `strides[0] = strides[3] = 1`.  For the most common case of the same
		horizontal and vertices strides, `strides = [1, stride, stride, 1]`.
		
		Args:
		  input: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `bfloat16`,
		    `float32`, `float64`.
		  filter: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `input`.
		  strides: A list of `ints`. 1-D of length 4.  The stride of the sliding
		    window for each dimension of `input`.
		  padding: Controls how to pad the image before applying the convolution. Can
		    be the string `"SAME"` or `"VALID"` indicating the type of padding
		    algorithm to use, or a list indicating the explicit paddings at the start
		    and end of each dimension. When explicit padding is used and data_format
		    is `"NHWC"`, this should be in the form `[[0, 0], [pad_top, pad_bottom],
		    [pad_left, pad_right], [0, 0]]`. When explicit padding used and
		    data_format is `"NCHW"`, this should be in the form `[[0, 0], [0, 0],
		    [pad_top, pad_bottom], [pad_left, pad_right]]`.
		  data_format: An optional `string` from: `"NHWC", "NCHW"`. Defaults to
		    `"NHWC"`. Specify the data format of the input and output data. With the
		    default format "NHWC", the data is stored in the order of: [batch, height,
		      width, channels].
		    Alternatively, the format could be "NCHW", the data storage order of:
		      [batch, channels, height, width].
		  dilations: An optional list of `ints`. Defaults to `[1, 1, 1, 1]`. 1-D
		    tensor of length 4.  The dilation factor for each dimension of `input`. If
		    set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element
		    on that dimension. The dimension order is determined by the value of
		    `data_format`, see above for details. Dilations in the batch and depth
		    dimensions must be 1.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		
		Returns:
		  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.

	/**
		Computes the grayscale dilation of 4-D `input` and 3-D `filter` tensors.
		
		The `input` tensor has shape `[batch, in_height, in_width, depth]` and the
		`filter` tensor has shape `[filter_height, filter_width, depth]`, i.e., each
		input channel is processed independently of the others with its own structuring

		`[batch, out_height, out_width, depth]`. The spatial dimensions of the output
		tensor depend on the `padding` algorithm. We currently only support the default

		Max-pooling is a special case when the filter has size equal to the pooling
		kernel size and contains all zeros.
		
		Note on duality: The dilation of `input` by the `filter` is equal to the
		negation of the erosion of `-input` by the reflected `filter`.

		```
		
		
		Args:
		  cell: An instance of RNNCell.
		  inputs: The RNN inputs.
		    If `time_major == False` (default), this must be a `Tensor` of shape:
		      `[batch_size, max_time, ...]`, or a nested tuple of such elements.
		    If `time_major == True`, this must be a `Tensor` of shape: `[max_time,
		      batch_size, ...]`, or a nested tuple of such elements. This may also be
		      a (possibly nested) tuple of Tensors satisfying this property.  The
		      first two dimensions must match across all the inputs, but otherwise the
		      ranks and other shape components may differ. In this case, input to
		      `cell` at each time-step will replicate the structure of these tuples,
		      except for the time dimension (from which the time is taken). The input
		      to `cell` at each time step will be a `Tensor` or (possibly nested)
		      tuple of Tensors each with dimensions `[batch_size, ...]`.
		  sequence_length: (optional) An int32/int64 vector sized `[batch_size]`. Used
		    to copy-through state and zero-out outputs when past a batch element's
		    sequence length.  This parameter enables users to extract the last valid
		    state and properly padded outputs, so it is provided for correctness.
		  initial_state: (optional) An initial state for the RNN. If `cell.state_size`
		    is an integer, this must be a `Tensor` of appropriate type and shape
		    `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`. If `cell.state_size` is a tuple, this
		    should be a tuple of tensors having shapes `[batch_size, s] for s in
		    cell.state_size`.
		  dtype: (optional) The data type for the initial state and expected output.
		    Required if initial_state is not provided or RNN state has a heterogeneous
		    dtype.
		  parallel_iterations: (Default: 32).  The number of iterations to run in
		    parallel.  Those operations which do not have any temporal dependency and
		    can be run in parallel, will be.  This parameter trades off time for
		    space.  Values >> 1 use more memory but take less time, while smaller
		    values use less memory but computations take longer.
		  swap_memory: Transparently swap the tensors produced in forward inference
		    but needed for back prop from GPU to CPU.  This allows training RNNs which
		    would typically not fit on a single GPU, with very minimal (or no)
		    performance penalty.
		  time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` Tensors. If true,
		    these `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size, depth]`. If false,
		    these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time, depth]`. Using
		    `time_major = True` is a bit more efficient because it avoids transposes
		    at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation.  However, most TensorFlow
		    data is batch-major, so by default this function accepts input and emits
		    output in batch-major form.
		  scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "rnn".
		
		Returns:
		  A pair (outputs, state) where:
		
		  outputs: The RNN output `Tensor`.
		
		    If time_major == False (default), this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
		      `[batch_size, max_time, cell.output_size]`.
		
		    If time_major == True, this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
		      `[max_time, batch_size, cell.output_size]`.
		
		    Note, if `cell.output_size` is a (possibly nested) tuple of integers
		    or `TensorShape` objects, then `outputs` will be a tuple having the
		    same structure as `cell.output_size`, containing Tensors having shapes
		    corresponding to the shape data in `cell.output_size`.
		
		  state: The final state.  If `cell.state_size` is an int, this
		    will be shaped `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`.  If it is a
		    `TensorShape`, this will be shaped `[batch_size] + cell.state_size`.
		    If it is a (possibly nested) tuple of ints or `TensorShape`, this will
		    be a tuple having the corresponding shapes. If cells are `LSTMCells`
		    `state` will be a tuple containing a `LSTMStateTuple` for each cell.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: If `cell` is not an instance of RNNCell.
		  ValueError: If inputs is None or an empty list.

		#### Structural Mapping to Native TF2
		
		Before:
		
		```python
		# create 2 LSTMCells
		rnn_layers = [tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(size) for size in [128, 256]]
		
		# create a RNN cell composed sequentially of a number of RNNCells

		# 'state' is a N-tuple where N is the number of LSTMCells containing a
		# tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMStateTuple for each cell
		outputs, state = tf.compat.v1.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell=multi_rnn_cell,

		```
		
		After:
		
		```python
		# RNN layer can take a list of cells, which will then stack them together.
		# By default, keras RNN will only return the last timestep output and will not
		# return states. If you need whole time sequence output as well as the states,
		# you can set `return_sequences` and `return_state` to True.
		rnn_layer = tf.keras.layers.RNN([tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(128),
		                                 tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(256)],

		This function is used to perform parallel lookups on the list of tensors in
		`params`.  It is a generalization of `tf.gather`, where `params` is
		interpreted as a partitioning of a large embedding tensor.  `params` may be
		a `PartitionedVariable` as returned by using `tf.compat.v1.get_variable()`
		with a partitioner.
		
		If `len(params) > 1`, each element `id` of `ids` is partitioned between
		the elements of `params` according to the `partition_strategy`.
		In all strategies, if the id space does not evenly divide the number of
		partitions, each of the first `(max_id + 1) % len(params)` partitions will
		be assigned one more id.
		
		If `partition_strategy` is `"mod"`, we assign each id to partition
		`p = id % len(params)`. For instance,
		13 ids are split across 5 partitions as:
		`[[0, 5, 10], [1, 6, 11], [2, 7, 12], [3, 8], [4, 9]]`
		
		If `partition_strategy` is `"div"`, we assign ids to partitions in a
		contiguous manner. In this case, 13 ids are split across 5 partitions as:
		`[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]`
		
		If the input ids are ragged tensors, partition variables are not supported and
		the partition strategy and the max_norm are ignored.
		The results of the lookup are concatenated into a dense
		tensor. The returned tensor has shape `shape(ids) + shape(params)[1:]`.
		
		Args:
		  params: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a
		    list of P tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension,
		    representing sharded embedding tensors.  Alternatively, a
		    `PartitionedVariable`, created by partitioning along dimension 0. Each
		    element must be appropriately sized for the given `partition_strategy`.
		  ids: A `Tensor` or a 'RaggedTensor' with type `int32` or `int64` containing
		    the ids to be looked up in `params`.
		  partition_strategy: A string specifying the partitioning strategy, relevant
		    if `len(params) > 1`. Currently `"div"` and `"mod"` are supported. Default
		    is `"mod"`.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		  validate_indices: DEPRECATED. If this operation is assigned to CPU, values
		    in `indices` are always validated to be within range.  If assigned to GPU,
		    out-of-bound indices result in safe but unspecified behavior, which may
		    include raising an error.
		  max_norm: If not `None`, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger
		    than this value.
		
		Returns:
		  A `Tensor` or a 'RaggedTensor', depending on the input, with the same type
		  as the tensors in `params`.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If `params` is empty.

		Looks up embeddings for the given ids and weights from a list of tensors.
		
		This op assumes that there is at least one id for each row in the dense tensor
		represented by sp_ids (i.e. there are no rows with empty features), and that
		all the indices of sp_ids are in canonical row-major order.
		
		`sp_ids` and `sp_weights` (if not None) are `SparseTensor`s with rank of 2.
		Embeddings are always aggregated along the last dimension.
		
		It also assumes that all id values lie in the range [0, p0), where p0
		is the sum of the size of params along dimension 0.
		
		Args:
		  params: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a
		    list tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension,
		    representing sharded embedding tensors. Alternatively, a
		    `PartitionedVariable`, created by partitioning along dimension 0. Each
		    element must be appropriately sized for the given `partition_strategy`.
		  sp_ids: N x M `SparseTensor` of int64 ids where N is typically batch size
		    and M is arbitrary.
		  sp_weights: either a `SparseTensor` of float / double weights, or `None` to
		    indicate all weights should be taken to be 1. If specified, `sp_weights`
		    must have exactly the same shape and indices as `sp_ids`.
		  partition_strategy: A string specifying the partitioning strategy, relevant
		    if `len(params) > 1`. Currently `"div"` and `"mod"` are supported. Default
		    is `"mod"`. See `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` for more details.
		  name: Optional name for the op.
		  combiner: A string specifying the reduction op. Currently "mean", "sqrtn"
		    and "sum" are supported. "sum" computes the weighted sum of the embedding
		    results for each row. "mean" is the weighted sum divided by the total
		    weight. "sqrtn" is the weighted sum divided by the square root of the sum
		    of the squares of the weights. Defaults to `mean`.
		  max_norm: If not `None`, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger
		    than this value, before combining.
		
		Returns:
		  A dense tensor representing the combined embeddings for the
		  sparse ids. For each row in the dense tensor represented by `sp_ids`, the op
		  looks up the embeddings for all ids in that row, multiplies them by the
		  corresponding weight, and combines these embeddings as specified.
		
		  In other words, if
		
		    `shape(combined params) = [p0, p1, ..., pm]`
		
		  and
		
		    `shape(sp_ids) = shape(sp_weights) = [d0, d1]`
		
		  then
		
		    `shape(output) = [d0, p1, ..., pm]`.
		
		  For instance, if params is a 10x20 matrix, and sp_ids / sp_weights are
		
		    ```python
		    [0, 0]: id 1, weight 2.0
		    [0, 1]: id 3, weight 0.5
		    [1, 0]: id 0, weight 1.0
		    [2, 3]: id 1, weight 3.0
		    ```
		
		  with `combiner`="mean", then the output will be a 3x20 matrix where
		
		    ```python
		    output[0, :] = (params[1, :] * 2.0 + params[3, :] * 0.5) / (2.0 + 0.5)
		    output[1, :] = (params[0, :] * 1.0) / 1.0
		    output[2, :] = (params[1, :] * 3.0) / 3.0
		    ```
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: If `sp_ids` is not a `SparseTensor`, or if `sp_weights` is
		    neither `None` nor `SparseTensor`.
		  ValueError: If `combiner` is not one of {"mean", "sqrtn", "sum"}.

		The elements of `sampled_candidates` are drawn without replacement
		(if `unique=True`) or with replacement (if `unique=False`) from

		The base distribution is read from a file or passed in as an

		In addition, this operation returns tensors `true_expected_count`
		and `sampled_expected_count` representing the number of times each
		of the target classes (`true_classes`) and the sampled
		classes (`sampled_candidates`) is expected to occur in an average
		tensor of sampled classes.  These values correspond to `Q(y|x)`
		defined in [this

		  range_max: An `int`. The number of possible classes.
		  vocab_file: Each valid line in this file (which should have a CSV-like

		  distortion: The distortion is used to skew the unigram probability
		    distribution.  Each weight is first raised to the distortion's power
		    before adding to the internal unigram distribution. As a result,
		    `distortion = 1.0` gives regular unigram sampling (as defined by the vocab

		  num_reserved_ids: Optionally some reserved IDs can be added in the range

		    unknown word token is used as ID 0. These IDs will have a sampling
		    probability of 0.
		  num_shards: A sampler can be used to sample from a subset of the original
		    range in order to speed up the whole computation through parallelism. This
		    parameter (together with `shard`) indicates the number of partitions that

		  shard: A sampler can be used to sample from a subset of the original range

		This is a deprecated version of `fractional_max_pool`.
		
		Fractional max pooling is slightly different than regular max pooling.  In
		regular max pooling, you downsize an input set by taking the maximum value of
		smaller N x N subsections of the set (often 2x2), and try to reduce the set by
		a factor of N, where N is an integer.  Fractional max pooling, as you might
		expect from the word "fractional", means that the overall reduction ratio N
		does not have to be an integer.
		
		The sizes of the pooling regions are generated randomly but are fairly
		uniform.  For example, let's look at the height dimension, and the constraints
		on the list of rows that will be pool boundaries.
		
		First we define the following:
		
		1.  input_row_length : the number of rows from the input set
		2.  output_row_length : which will be smaller than the input
		3.  alpha = input_row_length / output_row_length : our reduction ratio
		4.  K = floor(alpha)
		5.  row_pooling_sequence : this is the result list of pool boundary rows
		
		Then, row_pooling_sequence should satisfy:
		
		1.  a[0] = 0 : the first value of the sequence is 0
		2.  a[end] = input_row_length : the last value of the sequence is the size
		3.  K <= (a[i+1] - a[i]) <= K+1 : all intervals are K or K+1 size
		4.  length(row_pooling_sequence) = output_row_length+1

		Samples a set of classes from a distribution learned during training.

		The elements of `sampled_candidates` are drawn without replacement
		(if `unique=True`) or with replacement (if `unique=False`) from

		The base distribution for this operation is constructed on the fly

		begins with a weight of 1, and is incremented by 1 each time it is
		seen as a target class.  The base distribution is not saved to checkpoints,
		so it is reset when the model is reloaded.
		
		In addition, this operation returns tensors `true_expected_count`
		and `sampled_expected_count` representing the number of times each
		of the target classes (`true_classes`) and the sampled
		classes (`sampled_candidates`) is expected to occur in an average

		Performs max pooling on the input.
		
		For a given window of `ksize`, takes the maximum value within that window.
		Used for reducing computation and preventing overfitting.
		
		Consider an example of pooling with 2x2, non-overlapping windows:
		
		>>> matrix = tf.constant([
		...     [0, 0, 1, 7],
		...     [0, 2, 0, 0],
		...     [5, 2, 0, 0],
		...     [0, 0, 9, 8],
		... ])
		>>> reshaped = tf.reshape(matrix, (1, 4, 4, 1))
		>>> tf.nn.max_pool(reshaped, ksize=2, strides=2, padding="SAME")
		<tf.Tensor: shape=(1, 2, 2, 1), dtype=int32, numpy=
		array([[[[2],
		         [7]],
		        [[5],
		         [9]]]], dtype=int32)>
		
		We can adjust the window size using the `ksize` parameter. For example, if we
		were to expand the window to 3:
		
		>>> tf.nn.max_pool(reshaped, ksize=3, strides=2, padding="SAME")
		<tf.Tensor: shape=(1, 2, 2, 1), dtype=int32, numpy=
		array([[[[5],
		         [7]],
		        [[9],
		         [9]]]], dtype=int32)>
		
		We've now picked up two additional large numbers (5 and 9) in two of the
		pooled spots.
		
		Note that our windows are now overlapping, since we're still moving by 2 units
		on each iteration. This is causing us to see the same 9 repeated twice, since
		it is part of two overlapping windows.
		
		We can adjust how far we move our window with each iteration using the
		`strides` parameter. Updating this to the same value as our window size
		eliminates the overlap:
		
		>>> tf.nn.max_pool(reshaped, ksize=3, strides=3, padding="SAME")
		<tf.Tensor: shape=(1, 2, 2, 1), dtype=int32, numpy=
		array([[[[2],
		         [7]],
		        [[5],
		         [9]]]], dtype=int32)>
		
		Because the window does not neatly fit into our input, padding is added around
		the edges, giving us the same result as when we used a 2x2 window. We can skip
		padding altogether and simply drop the windows that do not fully fit into our
		input by instead passing `"VALID"` to the `padding` argument:
		
		>>> tf.nn.max_pool(reshaped, ksize=3, strides=3, padding="VALID")
		<tf.Tensor: shape=(1, 1, 1, 1), dtype=int32, numpy=array([[[[5]]]],
		 dtype=int32)>
		
		Now we've grabbed the largest value in the 3x3 window starting from the upper-
		left corner. Since no other windows fit in our input, they are dropped.

		Computes and returns the noise-contrastive estimation training loss.
		
		A common use case is to use this method for training, and calculate the full
		sigmoid loss for evaluation or inference. In this case, you must set
		`partition_strategy="div"` for the two losses to be consistent, as in the
		following example:
		
		```python
		if mode == "train":
		  loss = tf.nn.nce_loss(
		      weights=weights,
		      biases=biases,
		      labels=labels,
		      inputs=inputs,
		      ...,
		      partition_strategy="div")
		elif mode == "eval":
		  logits = tf.matmul(inputs, tf.transpose(weights))
		  logits = tf.nn.bias_add(logits, biases)
		  labels_one_hot = tf.one_hot(labels, n_classes)
		  loss = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(
		      labels=labels_one_hot,
		      logits=logits)
		  loss = tf.reduce_sum(loss, axis=1)
		```
		
		Note: By default this uses a log-uniform (Zipfian) distribution for sampling,
		so your labels must be sorted in order of decreasing frequency to achieve
		good results.  For more details, see
		`tf.random.log_uniform_candidate_sampler`.
		
		Note: In the case where `num_true` > 1, we assign to each target class
		the target probability 1 / `num_true` so that the target probabilities
		sum to 1 per-example.
		
		Note: It would be useful to allow a variable number of target classes per
		example.  We hope to provide this functionality in a future release.
		For now, if you have a variable number of target classes, you can pad them
		out to a constant number by either repeating them or by padding
		with an otherwise unused class.
		
		Args:
		  weights: A `Tensor` of shape `[num_classes, dim]`, or a list of `Tensor`
		      objects whose concatenation along dimension 0 has shape
		      [num_classes, dim].  The (possibly-partitioned) class embeddings.
		  biases: A `Tensor` of shape `[num_classes]`.  The class biases.
		  labels: A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[batch_size,
		      num_true]`. The target classes.
		  inputs: A `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, dim]`.  The forward
		      activations of the input network.
		  num_sampled: An `int`.  The number of negative classes to randomly sample
		      per batch. This single sample of negative classes is evaluated for each
		      element in the batch.
		  num_classes: An `int`. The number of possible classes.
		  num_true: An `int`.  The number of target classes per training example.
		  sampled_values: a tuple of (`sampled_candidates`, `true_expected_count`,
		      `sampled_expected_count`) returned by a `*_candidate_sampler` function.
		      (if None, we default to `log_uniform_candidate_sampler`)
		  remove_accidental_hits:  A `bool`.  Whether to remove "accidental hits"
		      where a sampled class equals one of the target classes.  If set to
		      `True`, this is a "Sampled Logistic" loss instead of NCE, and we are
		      learning to generate log-odds instead of log probabilities. See
		      our Candidate Sampling Algorithms Reference
		      ([pdf](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/candidate_sampling.pdf)).
		      Default is False.
		  partition_strategy: A string specifying the partitioning strategy, relevant
		      if `len(weights) > 1`. Currently `"div"` and `"mod"` are supported.
		      Default is `"mod"`. See `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` for more details.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		
		Returns:

		Creates an `RNN` specified by RNNCell `cell` and loop function `loop_fn`.
		
		**NOTE: This method is still in testing, and the API may change.**
		
		This function is a more primitive version of `dynamic_rnn` that provides
		more direct access to the inputs each iteration.  It also provides more
		control over when to start and finish reading the sequence, and
		what to emit for the output.
		
		For example, it can be used to implement the dynamic decoder of a seq2seq
		model.
		
		Instead of working with `Tensor` objects, most operations work with
		`TensorArray` objects directly.
		
		The operation of `raw_rnn`, in pseudo-code, is basically the following:
		
		```python
		time = tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.int32)
		(finished, next_input, initial_state, emit_structure, loop_state) = loop_fn(
		    time=time, cell_output=None, cell_state=None, loop_state=None)
		emit_ta = TensorArray(dynamic_size=True, dtype=initial_state.dtype)
		state = initial_state
		while not all(finished):
		  (output, cell_state) = cell(next_input, state)
		  (next_finished, next_input, next_state, emit, loop_state) = loop_fn(
		      time=time + 1, cell_output=output, cell_state=cell_state,
		      loop_state=loop_state)
		  # Emit zeros and copy forward state for minibatch entries that are finished.
		  state = tf.where(finished, state, next_state)
		  emit = tf.where(finished, tf.zeros_like(emit_structure), emit)
		  emit_ta = emit_ta.write(time, emit)
		  # If any new minibatch entries are marked as finished, mark these.
		  finished = tf.logical_or(finished, next_finished)
		  time += 1
		return (emit_ta, state, loop_state)
		```
		
		with the additional properties that output and state may be (possibly nested)
		tuples, as determined by `cell.output_size` and `cell.state_size`, and
		as a result the final `state` and `emit_ta` may themselves be tuples.
		
		A simple implementation of `dynamic_rnn` via `raw_rnn` looks like this:
		
		```python
		inputs = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(shape=(max_time, batch_size, input_depth),
		                        dtype=tf.float32)

		inputs_ta = inputs_ta.unstack(inputs)
		
		cell = tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(num_units)
		
		def loop_fn(time, cell_output, cell_state, loop_state):
		  emit_output = cell_output  # == None for time == 0
		  if cell_output is None:  # time == 0
		    next_cell_state = cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float32)

		    next_cell_state = cell_state

		  next_input = tf.cond(
		      finished,

		  next_loop_state = None
		  return (elements_finished, next_input, next_cell_state,
		          emit_output, next_loop_state)
		
		outputs_ta, final_state, _ = raw_rnn(cell, loop_fn)
		outputs = outputs_ta.stack()
		```
		
		Args:
		  cell: An instance of RNNCell.
		  loop_fn: A callable that takes inputs `(time, cell_output, cell_state,
		    loop_state)` and returns the tuple `(finished, next_input,
		    next_cell_state, emit_output, next_loop_state)`. Here `time` is an int32
		    scalar `Tensor`, `cell_output` is a `Tensor` or (possibly nested) tuple of
		    tensors as determined by `cell.output_size`, and `cell_state` is a
		    `Tensor` or (possibly nested) tuple of tensors, as determined by the
		    `loop_fn` on its first call (and should match `cell.state_size`).
		    The outputs are: `finished`, a boolean `Tensor` of
		    shape `[batch_size]`, `next_input`: the next input to feed to `cell`,
		    `next_cell_state`: the next state to feed to `cell`,
		    and `emit_output`: the output to store for this iteration.  Note that
		      `emit_output` should be a `Tensor` or (possibly nested) tuple of tensors
		      which is aggregated in the `emit_ta` inside the `while_loop`. For the
		      first call to `loop_fn`, the `emit_output` corresponds to the
		      `emit_structure` which is then used to determine the size of the
		      `zero_tensor` for the `emit_ta` (defaults to `cell.output_size`). For
		      the subsequent calls to the `loop_fn`, the `emit_output` corresponds to
		      the actual output tensor that is to be aggregated in the `emit_ta`. The
		      parameter `cell_state` and output `next_cell_state` may be either a
		      single or (possibly nested) tuple of tensors.  The parameter
		      `loop_state` and output `next_loop_state` may be either a single or
		      (possibly nested) tuple of `Tensor` and `TensorArray` objects.  This
		      last parameter may be ignored by `loop_fn` and the return value may be
		      `None`.  If it is not `None`, then the `loop_state` will be propagated
		      through the RNN loop, for use purely by `loop_fn` to keep track of its
		      own state. The `next_loop_state` parameter returned may be `None`.  The
		      first call to `loop_fn` will be `time = 0`, `cell_output = None`,
		    `cell_state = None`, and `loop_state = None`.  For this call: The
		      `next_cell_state` value should be the value with which to initialize the
		      cell's state.  It may be a final state from a previous RNN or it may be
		      the output of `cell.zero_state()`.  It should be a (possibly nested)
		      tuple structure of tensors. If `cell.state_size` is an integer, this
		      must be a `Tensor` of appropriate type and shape `[batch_size,
		      cell.state_size]`. If `cell.state_size` is a `TensorShape`, this must be
		      a `Tensor` of appropriate type and shape `[batch_size] +
		      cell.state_size`. If `cell.state_size` is a (possibly nested) tuple of
		      ints or `TensorShape`, this will be a tuple having the corresponding
		      shapes. The `emit_output` value may be either `None` or a (possibly
		      nested) tuple structure of tensors, e.g., `(tf.zeros(shape_0,
		      dtype=dtype_0), tf.zeros(shape_1, dtype=dtype_1))`. If this first
		      `emit_output` return value is `None`, then the `emit_ta` result of
		      `raw_rnn` will have the same structure and dtypes as `cell.output_size`.
		      Otherwise `emit_ta` will have the same structure, shapes (prepended with
		      a `batch_size` dimension), and dtypes as `emit_output`.  The actual
		      values returned for `emit_output` at this initializing call are ignored.
		      Note, this emit structure must be consistent across all time steps.
		  parallel_iterations: (Default: 32).  The number of iterations to run in
		    parallel.  Those operations which do not have any temporal dependency and
		    can be run in parallel, will be.  This parameter trades off time for
		    space.  Values >> 1 use more memory but take less time, while smaller
		    values use less memory but computations take longer.
		  swap_memory: Transparently swap the tensors produced in forward inference
		    but needed for back prop from GPU to CPU.  This allows training RNNs which
		    would typically not fit on a single GPU, with very minimal (or no)
		    performance penalty.
		  scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "rnn".
		
		Returns:
		  A tuple `(emit_ta, final_state, final_loop_state)` where:
		
		  `emit_ta`: The RNN output `TensorArray`.
		     If `loop_fn` returns a (possibly nested) set of Tensors for
		     `emit_output` during initialization, (inputs `time = 0`,
		     `cell_output = None`, and `loop_state = None`), then `emit_ta` will
		     have the same structure, dtypes, and shapes as `emit_output` instead.
		     If `loop_fn` returns `emit_output = None` during this call,
		     the structure of `cell.output_size` is used:
		     If `cell.output_size` is a (possibly nested) tuple of integers
		     or `TensorShape` objects, then `emit_ta` will be a tuple having the
		     same structure as `cell.output_size`, containing TensorArrays whose
		     elements' shapes correspond to the shape data in `cell.output_size`.
		
		  `final_state`: The final cell state.  If `cell.state_size` is an int, this
		    will be shaped `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`.  If it is a
		    `TensorShape`, this will be shaped `[batch_size] + cell.state_size`.
		    If it is a (possibly nested) tuple of ints or `TensorShape`, this will
		    be a tuple having the corresponding shapes.
		
		  `final_loop_state`: The final loop state as returned by `loop_fn`.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: If `cell` is not an instance of RNNCell, or `loop_fn` is not

		The partitioned embedding in `embedding_weights` must all be the same shape

		Computes sigmoid cross entropy given `logits`.
		
		Measures the probability error in tasks with two outcomes in which each
		outcome is independent and need not have a fully certain label. For instance,
		one could perform a regression where the probability of an event happening is
		known and used as a label. This loss may also be used for binary
		classification, where labels are either zero or one.
		
		For brevity, let `x = logits`, `z = labels`.  The logistic loss is
		
		      z * -log(sigmoid(x)) + (1 - z) * -log(1 - sigmoid(x))
		    = z * -log(1 / (1 + exp(-x))) + (1 - z) * -log(exp(-x) / (1 + exp(-x)))

		    = z * log(1 + exp(-x)) + (1 - z) * (x + log(1 + exp(-x))
		    = (1 - z) * x + log(1 + exp(-x))
		    = x - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))
		
		For x < 0, to avoid overflow in exp(-x), we reformulate the above
		
		      x - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))
		    = log(exp(x)) - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))
		    = - x * z + log(1 + exp(x))
		
		Hence, to ensure stability and avoid overflow, the implementation uses this

		`tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` for general multi-class

		More specifically, this op outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from
		the `height` and `width` dimensions are moved to the `batch` dimension. After
		the zero-padding, both `height` and `width` of the input must be divisible by the

		The shape of the output will be:
		
		    [batch*block_size*block_size, height_pad/block_size, width_pad/block_size,
		     depth]
		
		Some examples:

		(3) For the following input of shape `[1, 4, 4, 1]` and block_size of 2:

		SpaceToDepth for tensors of type T.
		
		Rearranges blocks of spatial data, into depth. More specifically,
		this op outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from the `height`
		and `width` dimensions are moved to the `depth` dimension.
		The attr `block_size` indicates the input block size.
		
		  * Non-overlapping blocks of size `block_size x block size` are rearranged
		    into depth at each location.
		  * The depth of the output tensor is `block_size * block_size * input_depth`.
		  * The Y, X coordinates within each block of the input become the high order
		    component of the output channel index.
		  * The input tensor's height and width must be divisible by block_size.
		
		The `data_format` attr specifies the layout of the input and output tensors
		with the following options:
		  "NHWC": `[ batch, height, width, channels ]`
		  "NCHW": `[ batch, channels, height, width ]`
		  "NCHW_VECT_C":
		      `qint8 [ batch, channels / 4, height, width, 4 ]`
		
		It is useful to consider the operation as transforming a 6-D Tensor.
		e.g. for data_format = NHWC,
		     Each element in the input tensor can be specified via 6 coordinates,
		     ordered by decreasing memory layout significance as:
		     n,oY,bY,oX,bX,iC  (where n=batch index, oX, oY means X or Y coordinates
		                        within the output image, bX, bY means coordinates
		                        within the input block, iC means input channels).
		     The output would be a transpose to the following layout:
		     n,oY,oX,bY,bX,iC
		
		This operation is useful for resizing the activations between convolutions
		(but keeping all data), e.g. instead of pooling. It is also useful for training
		purely convolutional models.
		
		For example, given an input of shape `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, data_format = "NHWC" and
		block_size = 2:
		
		```
		x = [[[[1], [2]],
		      [[3], [4]]]]
		```
		
		This operation will output a tensor of shape `[1, 1, 1, 4]`:
		
		```
		[[[[1, 2, 3, 4]]]]
		```
		
		Here, the input has a batch of 1 and each batch element has shape `[2, 2, 1]`,
		the corresponding output will have a single element (i.e. width and height are
		both 1) and will have a depth of 4 channels (1 * block_size * block_size).
		The output element shape is `[1, 1, 4]`.
		
		For an input tensor with larger depth, here of shape `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, e.g.
		
		```
		x = [[[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
		      [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]]
		```
		
		This operation, for block_size of 2, will return the following tensor of shape
		`[1, 1, 1, 12]`
		
		```
		[[[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]]]]
		```
		
		Similarly, for the following input of shape `[1 4 4 1]`, and a block size of 2:
		
		```
		x = [[[[1],   [2],  [5],  [6]],
		      [[3],   [4],  [7],  [8]],
		      [[9],  [10], [13],  [14]],
		      [[11], [12], [15],  [16]]]]
		```
		
		the operator will return the following tensor of shape `[1 2 2 4]`:
		
		```
		x = [[[[1, 2, 3, 4],
		       [5, 6, 7, 8]],
		      [[9, 10, 11, 12],
		       [13, 14, 15, 16]]]]
		```

		Computes a weighted cross entropy. (deprecated arguments)
		
		Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(targets)`. They will be removed in a future version.
		Instructions for updating:
		targets is deprecated, use labels instead
		
		This is like `sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits()` except that `pos_weight`,
		allows one to trade off recall and precision by up- or down-weighting the
		cost of a positive error relative to a negative error.
		
		The usual cross-entropy cost is defined as:
		
		    labels * -log(sigmoid(logits)) +
		        (1 - labels) * -log(1 - sigmoid(logits))
		
		A value `pos_weight > 1` decreases the false negative count, hence increasing
		the recall.
		Conversely setting `pos_weight < 1` decreases the false positive count and
		increases the precision.
		This can be seen from the fact that `pos_weight` is introduced as a
		multiplicative coefficient for the positive labels term
		in the loss expression:
		
		    labels * -log(sigmoid(logits)) * pos_weight +
		        (1 - labels) * -log(1 - sigmoid(logits))
		
		For brevity, let `x = logits`, `z = labels`, `q = pos_weight`.
		The loss is:
		
		      qz * -log(sigmoid(x)) + (1 - z) * -log(1 - sigmoid(x))
		    = qz * -log(1 / (1 + exp(-x))) + (1 - z) * -log(exp(-x) / (1 + exp(-x)))
		    = qz * log(1 + exp(-x)) + (1 - z) * (-log(exp(-x)) + log(1 + exp(-x)))
		    = qz * log(1 + exp(-x)) + (1 - z) * (x + log(1 + exp(-x))
		    = (1 - z) * x + (qz +  1 - z) * log(1 + exp(-x))
		    = (1 - z) * x + (1 + (q - 1) * z) * log(1 + exp(-x))
		
		Setting `l = (1 + (q - 1) * z)`, to ensure stability and avoid overflow,
		the implementation uses
		
		    (1 - z) * x + l * (log(1 + exp(-abs(x))) + max(-x, 0))
		
		`logits` and `labels` must have the same type and shape.

		Performs `op` on the space-to-batch representation of `input`.
		
		This has the effect of transforming sliding window operations into the
		corresponding "atrous" operation in which the input is sampled at the
		specified `dilation_rate`.
		
		In the special case that `dilation_rate` is uniformly 1, this simply returns:
		
		  op(input, num_spatial_dims, padding)
		
		Otherwise, it returns:
		
		  batch_to_space_nd(
		    op(space_to_batch_nd(input, adjusted_dilation_rate, adjusted_paddings),
		       num_spatial_dims,
		       "VALID")
		    adjusted_dilation_rate,
		    adjusted_crops),
		
		where:
		
		  adjusted_dilation_rate is an int64 tensor of shape [max(spatial_dims)],
		  adjusted_{paddings,crops} are int64 tensors of shape [max(spatial_dims), 2]
		
		defined as follows:
		
		We first define two int64 tensors `paddings` and `crops` of shape
		`[num_spatial_dims, 2]` based on the value of `padding` and the spatial
		dimensions of the `input`:
		
		If `padding = "VALID"`, then:
		
		  paddings, crops = required_space_to_batch_paddings(
		    input_shape[spatial_dims],
		    dilation_rate)
		
		If `padding = "SAME"`, then:
		
		  dilated_filter_shape =
		    filter_shape + (filter_shape - 1) * (dilation_rate - 1)
		
		  paddings, crops = required_space_to_batch_paddings(
		    input_shape[spatial_dims],
		    dilation_rate,
		    [(dilated_filter_shape - 1) // 2,
		     dilated_filter_shape - 1 - (dilated_filter_shape - 1) // 2])
		
		Because `space_to_batch_nd` and `batch_to_space_nd` assume that the spatial
		dimensions are contiguous starting at the second dimension, but the specified
		`spatial_dims` may not be, we must adjust `dilation_rate`, `paddings` and
		`crops` in order to be usable with these operations.  For a given dimension,
		if the block size is 1, and both the starting and ending padding and crop
		amounts are 0, then space_to_batch_nd effectively leaves that dimension alone,
		which is what is needed for dimensions not part of `spatial_dims`.
		Furthermore, `space_to_batch_nd` and `batch_to_space_nd` handle this case
		efficiently for any number of leading and trailing dimensions.
		
		For 0 <= i < len(spatial_dims), we assign:
		
		  adjusted_dilation_rate[spatial_dims[i] - 1] = dilation_rate[i]
		  adjusted_paddings[spatial_dims[i] - 1, :] = paddings[i, :]
		  adjusted_crops[spatial_dims[i] - 1, :] = crops[i, :]
		
		All unassigned values of `adjusted_dilation_rate` default to 1, while all
		unassigned values of `adjusted_paddings` and `adjusted_crops` default to 0.
		
		Note in the case that `dilation_rate` is not uniformly 1, specifying "VALID"
		padding is equivalent to specifying `padding = "SAME"` with a filter_shape of
		`[1]*N`.
		
		Advanced usage. Note the following optimization: A sequence of
		`with_space_to_batch` operations with identical (not uniformly 1)
		`dilation_rate` parameters and "VALID" padding
		
		  net = with_space_to_batch(net, dilation_rate, "VALID", op_1)
		  ...
		  net = with_space_to_batch(net, dilation_rate, "VALID", op_k)
		
		can be combined into a single `with_space_to_batch` operation as follows:
		
		  def combined_op(converted_input, num_spatial_dims, _):
		    result = op_1(converted_input, num_spatial_dims, "VALID")
		    ...
		    result = op_k(result, num_spatial_dims, "VALID")
		
		  net = with_space_to_batch(net, dilation_rate, "VALID", combined_op)
		
		This eliminates the overhead of `k-1` calls to `space_to_batch_nd` and
		`batch_to_space_nd`.
		
		Similarly, a sequence of `with_space_to_batch` operations with identical (not
		uniformly 1) `dilation_rate` parameters, "SAME" padding, and odd filter
		dimensions
		
		  net = with_space_to_batch(net, dilation_rate, "SAME", op_1, filter_shape_1)
		  ...
		  net = with_space_to_batch(net, dilation_rate, "SAME", op_k, filter_shape_k)

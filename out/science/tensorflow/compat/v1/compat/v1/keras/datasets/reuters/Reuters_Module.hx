	/**
		Loads the Reuters newswire classification dataset.
		
		This is a dataset of 11,228 newswires from Reuters, labeled over 46 topics.
		
		This was originally generated by parsing and preprocessing the classic
		Reuters-21578 dataset, but the preprocessing code is no longer packaged
		with Keras. See this
		[github discussion](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/12072)
		for more info.
		
		Each newswire is encoded as a list of word indexes (integers).
		For convenience, words are indexed by overall frequency in the dataset,
		so that for instance the integer "3" encodes the 3rd most frequent word in
		the data. This allows for quick filtering operations such as:
		"only consider the top 10,000 most
		common words, but eliminate the top 20 most common words".
		
		As a convention, "0" does not stand for a specific word, but instead is used
		to encode any unknown word.
		
		Args:
		  path: where to cache the data (relative to `~/.keras/dataset`).
		  num_words: integer or None. Words are
		      ranked by how often they occur (in the training set) and only
		      the `num_words` most frequent words are kept. Any less frequent word
		      will appear as `oov_char` value in the sequence data. If None,
		      all words are kept. Defaults to None, so all words are kept.
		  skip_top: skip the top N most frequently occurring words
		      (which may not be informative). These words will appear as
		      `oov_char` value in the dataset. Defaults to 0, so no words are
		      skipped.
		  maxlen: int or None. Maximum sequence length.
		      Any longer sequence will be truncated. Defaults to None, which
		      means no truncation.
		  test_split: Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the dataset to be used
		    as test data. Defaults to 0.2, meaning 20% of the dataset is used as
		    test data.
		  seed: int. Seed for reproducible data shuffling.
		  start_char: int. The start of a sequence will be marked with this
		      character. Defaults to 1 because 0 is usually the padding character.
		  oov_char: int. The out-of-vocabulary character.
		      Words that were cut out because of the `num_words` or
		      `skip_top` limits will be replaced with this character.
		  index_from: int. Index actual words with this index and higher.
		  **kwargs: Used for backwards compatibility.
		
		Returns:
		  Tuple of Numpy arrays: `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)`.
		
		**x_train, x_test**: lists of sequences, which are lists of indexes
		  (integers). If the num_words argument was specific, the maximum
		  possible index value is `num_words - 1`. If the `maxlen` argument was
		  specified, the largest possible sequence length is `maxlen`.
		
		**y_train, y_test**: lists of integer labels (1 or 0).
		
		Note: The 'out of vocabulary' character is only used for
		words that were present in the training set but are not included
		because they're not making the `num_words` cut here.
		Words that were not seen in the training set but are in the test set
		have simply been skipped.

		Calculates how often `predictions` matches `labels`.
		
		The `accuracy` function creates two local variables, `total` and
		`count` that are used to compute the frequency with which `predictions`
		matches `labels`. This frequency is ultimately returned as `accuracy`: an
		idempotent operation that simply divides `total` by `count`.
		
		For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
		`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `accuracy`.
		Internally, an `is_correct` operation computes a `Tensor` with elements 1.0
		where the corresponding elements of `predictions` and `labels` match and 0.0
		otherwise. Then `update_op` increments `total` with the reduced sum of the
		product of `weights` and `is_correct`, and it increments `count` with the
		reduced sum of `weights`.
		
		If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.
		
		Args:
		  labels: The ground truth values, a `Tensor` whose shape matches
		    `predictions`.
		  predictions: The predicted values, a `Tensor` of any shape.
		  weights: Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as
		    `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must
		    be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).
		  metrics_collections: An optional list of collections that `accuracy` should
		    be added to.
		  updates_collections: An optional list of collections that `update_op` should
		    be added to.
		  name: An optional variable_scope name.
		
		Returns:
		  accuracy: A `Tensor` representing the accuracy, the value of `total` divided
		    by `count`.
		  update_op: An operation that increments the `total` and `count` variables
		    appropriately and whose value matches `accuracy`.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If `predictions` and `labels` have mismatched shapes, or if
		    `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`, or if
		    either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or
		    tuple.
		  RuntimeError: If eager execution is enabled.
		
		@compatibility(TF2)
		`tf.compat.v1.metrics.accuracy` is not compatible with eager
		execution or `tf.function`.
		Please use `tf.keras.metrics.Accuracy` instead for TF2 migration. After
		instantiating a `tf.keras.metrics.Accuracy` object, you can first call the
		`update_state()` method to record the prediction/labels, and then call the
		`result()` method to get the accuracy eagerly. You can also attach it to a
		Keras model when calling the `compile` method. Please refer to [this
		guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate#new-style_metrics_and_losses)
		for more details.
		
		#### Structural Mapping to Native TF2
		
		Before:
		
		```python
		accuracy, update_op = tf.compat.v1.metrics.accuracy(
		  labels=labels,
		  predictions=predictions,
		  weights=weights,
		  metrics_collections=metrics_collections,
		  update_collections=update_collections,
		  name=name)
		```
		
		After:
		
		```python
		 m = tf.keras.metrics.Accuracy(
		   name=name,
		   dtype=None)
		
		 m.update_state(
		 y_true=labels,
		 y_pred=predictions,
		 sample_weight=weights)
		
		 accuracy = m.result()
		```

	/**
		Computes the approximate AUC via a Riemann sum. (deprecated)
		
		Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
		Instructions for updating:
		The value of AUC returned by this may race with the update so this is deprecated. Please use tf.keras.metrics.AUC instead.
		
		The `auc` function creates four local variables, `true_positives`,
		`true_negatives`, `false_positives` and `false_negatives` that are used to
		compute the AUC. To discretize the AUC curve, a linearly spaced set of
		thresholds is used to compute pairs of recall and precision values. The area
		under the ROC-curve is therefore computed using the height of the recall
		values by the false positive rate, while the area under the PR-curve is the
		computed using the height of the precision values by the recall.
		
		This value is ultimately returned as `auc`, an idempotent operation that
		computes the area under a discretized curve of precision versus recall values
		(computed using the aforementioned variables). The `num_thresholds` variable
		controls the degree of discretization with larger numbers of thresholds more
		closely approximating the true AUC. The quality of the approximation may vary
		dramatically depending on `num_thresholds`.
		
		For best results, `predictions` should be distributed approximately uniformly
		in the range [0, 1] and not peaked around 0 or 1. The quality of the AUC
		approximation may be poor if this is not the case. Setting `summation_method`
		to 'minoring' or 'majoring' can help quantify the error in the approximation
		by providing lower or upper bound estimate of the AUC. The `thresholds`
		parameter can be used to manually specify thresholds which split the
		predictions more evenly.
		
		For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
		`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `auc`.
		
		If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.
		
		Args:
		  labels: A `Tensor` whose shape matches `predictions`. Will be cast to
		    `bool`.
		  predictions: A floating point `Tensor` of arbitrary shape and whose values
		    are in the range `[0, 1]`.
		  weights: Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as
		    `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must
		    be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).
		  num_thresholds: The number of thresholds to use when discretizing the roc
		    curve.
		  metrics_collections: An optional list of collections that `auc` should be
		    added to.
		  updates_collections: An optional list of collections that `update_op` should
		    be added to.
		  curve: Specifies the name of the curve to be computed, 'ROC' [default] or
		    'PR' for the Precision-Recall-curve.
		  name: An optional variable_scope name.
		  summation_method: Specifies the Riemann summation method used
		    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum): 'trapezoidal' [default] that
		    applies the trapezoidal rule; 'careful_interpolation', a variant of it
		    differing only by a more correct interpolation scheme for PR-AUC -
		    interpolating (true/false) positives but not the ratio that is precision;
		    'minoring' that applies left summation for increasing intervals and right
		    summation for decreasing intervals; 'majoring' that does the opposite.
		    Note that 'careful_interpolation' is strictly preferred to 'trapezoidal'
		    (to be deprecated soon) as it applies the same method for ROC, and a
		    better one (see Davis & Goadrich 2006 for details) for the PR curve.
		  thresholds: An optional list of floating point values to use as the
		    thresholds for discretizing the curve. If set, the `num_thresholds`
		    parameter is ignored. Values should be in [0, 1]. Endpoint thresholds
		    equal to {-epsilon, 1+epsilon} for a small positive epsilon value will be
		    automatically included with these to correctly handle predictions equal to
		     exactly 0 or 1.
		
		Returns:
		  auc: A scalar `Tensor` representing the current area-under-curve.
		  update_op: An operation that increments the `true_positives`,
		    `true_negatives`, `false_positives` and `false_negatives` variables
		    appropriately and whose value matches `auc`.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If `predictions` and `labels` have mismatched shapes, or if
		    `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`, or if
		    either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or

		Computes average precision@k of predictions with respect to sparse labels.
		
		`average_precision_at_k` creates two local variables,
		`average_precision_at_<k>/total` and `average_precision_at_<k>/max`, that
		are used to compute the frequency. This frequency is ultimately returned as
		`average_precision_at_<k>`: an idempotent operation that simply divides

		For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
		`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
		`precision_at_<k>`. Internally, a `top_k` operation computes a `Tensor`
		indicating the top `k` `predictions`. Set operations applied to `top_k` and

		`weights`. Then `update_op` increments `true_positive_at_<k>` and

		  predictions: Float `Tensor` with shape [D1, ... DN, num_classes] where
		    N >= 1. Commonly, N=1 and `predictions` has shape
		    [batch size, num_classes]. The final dimension contains the logit values

		Mean Intersection-Over-Union is a common evaluation metric for
		semantic image segmentation, which first computes the IOU for each
		semantic class and then computes the average over classes.
		IOU is defined as follows:
		  IOU = true_positive / (true_positive + false_positive + false_negative).
		The predictions are accumulated in a confusion matrix, weighted by `weights`,
		and mIOU is then calculated from it.
		
		For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
		`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `mean_iou`.
		
		If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.
		
		Args:
		  labels: A `Tensor` of ground truth labels with shape [batch size] and of
		    type `int32` or `int64`. The tensor will be flattened if its rank > 1.
		  predictions: A `Tensor` of prediction results for semantic labels, whose
		    shape is [batch size] and type `int32` or `int64`. The tensor will be
		    flattened if its rank > 1.
		  num_classes: The possible number of labels the prediction task can
		    have. This value must be provided, since a confusion matrix of
		    dimension = [num_classes, num_classes] will be allocated.
		  weights: Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as
		    `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must
		    be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).
		  metrics_collections: An optional list of collections that `mean_iou`
		    should be added to.
		  updates_collections: An optional list of collections `update_op` should be
		    added to.
		  name: An optional variable_scope name.
		
		Returns:
		  mean_iou: A `Tensor` representing the mean intersection-over-union.

		For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an

		If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.
		
		Args:

		  predictions: Float `Tensor` with shape [D1, ... DN, num_classes] where

		    The final dimension contains the logit values for each class. [D1, ... DN]
		    must match `labels`.
		  k: Integer, k for @k metric.
		  class_id: Integer class ID for which we want binary metrics. This should be
		    in range [0, num_classes), where num_classes is the last dimension of
		    `predictions`. If class_id is outside this range, the method returns NAN.
		  weights: `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or n-1, where n is the rank of
		    `labels`. If the latter, it must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all
		    dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels`
		    dimension).
		  metrics_collections: An optional list of collections that values should

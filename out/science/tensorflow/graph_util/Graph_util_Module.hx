	/**
		Imports the graph from `graph_def` into the current default `Graph`. (deprecated arguments)
		
		Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(op_dict)`. They will be removed in a future version.
		Instructions for updating:
		Please file an issue at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues if you depend on this feature.
		
		This function provides a way to import a serialized TensorFlow
		[`GraphDef`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/framework/graph.proto)
		protocol buffer, and extract individual objects in the `GraphDef` as
		`tf.Tensor` and `tf.Operation` objects. Once extracted,
		these objects are placed into the current default `Graph`. See
		`tf.Graph.as_graph_def` for a way to create a `GraphDef`
		proto.
		
		Args:
		  graph_def: A `GraphDef` proto containing operations to be imported into
		    the default graph.
		  input_map: A dictionary mapping input names (as strings) in `graph_def`
		    to `Tensor` objects. The values of the named input tensors in the
		    imported graph will be re-mapped to the respective `Tensor` values.
		  return_elements: A list of strings containing operation names in
		    `graph_def` that will be returned as `Operation` objects; and/or
		    tensor names in `graph_def` that will be returned as `Tensor` objects.
		  name: (Optional.) A prefix that will be prepended to the names in
		    `graph_def`. Note that this does not apply to imported function names.
		    Defaults to `"import"`.
		  op_dict: (Optional.) Deprecated, do not use.
		  producer_op_list: (Optional.) An `OpList` proto with the (possibly stripped)
		    list of `OpDef`s used by the producer of the graph. If provided,
		    unrecognized attrs for ops in `graph_def` that have their default value
		    according to `producer_op_list` will be removed. This will allow some more
		    `GraphDef`s produced by later binaries to be accepted by earlier binaries.
		
		Returns:
		  A list of `Operation` and/or `Tensor` objects from the imported graph,
		  corresponding to the names in `return_elements`,
		  and None if `returns_elements` is None.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: If `graph_def` is not a `GraphDef` proto,
		    `input_map` is not a dictionary mapping strings to `Tensor` objects,
		    or `return_elements` is not a list of strings.
		  ValueError: If `input_map`, or `return_elements` contains names that
		    do not appear in `graph_def`, or `graph_def` is not well-formed (e.g.
		    it refers to an unknown tensor).

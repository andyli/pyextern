	/**
		Return a mask representing connectivity of a locally-connected operation.
		
		This method returns a masking numpy array of 0s and 1s (of type `np.float32`)
		that, when element-wise multiplied with a fully-connected weight tensor, masks
		out the weights between disconnected input-output pairs and thus implements
		local connectivity through a sparse fully-connected weight tensor.
		
		Assume an unshared convolution with given parameters is applied to an input
		having N spatial dimensions with `input_shape = (d_in1, ..., d_inN)`
		to produce an output with spatial shape `(d_out1, ..., d_outN)` (determined
		by layer parameters such as `strides`).
		
		This method returns a mask which can be broadcast-multiplied (element-wise)
		with a 2*(N+1)-D weight matrix (equivalent to a fully-connected layer between
		(N+1)-D activations (N spatial + 1 channel dimensions for input and output)
		to make it perform an unshared convolution with given `kernel_shape`,
		`strides`, `padding` and `data_format`.
		
		Args:
		  input_shape: tuple of size N: `(d_in1, ..., d_inN)` spatial shape of the
		    input.
		  kernel_shape: tuple of size N, spatial shape of the convolutional kernel /
		    receptive field.
		  strides: tuple of size N, strides along each spatial dimension.
		  padding: type of padding, string `"same"` or `"valid"`.
		  data_format: a string, `"channels_first"` or `"channels_last"`.
		
		Returns:
		  a `np.float32`-type `np.ndarray` of shape
		  `(1, d_in1, ..., d_inN, 1, d_out1, ..., d_outN)`
		  if `data_format == `"channels_first"`, or
		  `(d_in1, ..., d_inN, 1, d_out1, ..., d_outN, 1)`
		  if `data_format == "channels_last"`.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: if `data_format` is neither `"channels_first"` nor
		              `"channels_last"`.

		Apply N-D convolution with un-shared weights using a single matmul call.
		
		This method outputs `inputs . (kernel * kernel_mask)`
		(with `.` standing for matrix-multiply and `*` for element-wise multiply)
		and requires a precomputed `kernel_mask` to zero-out weights in `kernel` and
		hence perform the same operation as a convolution with un-shared
		(the remaining entries in `kernel`) weights. It also does the necessary
		reshapes to make `inputs` and `kernel` 2-D and `output` (N+2)-D.
		
		Args:
		    inputs: (N+2)-D tensor with shape `(batch_size, channels_in, d_in1, ...,
		      d_inN)` or `(batch_size, d_in1, ..., d_inN, channels_in)`.
		    kernel: the unshared weights for N-D convolution,
		        an (N+2)-D tensor of shape: `(d_in1, ..., d_inN, channels_in, d_out2,
		          ..., d_outN, channels_out)` or `(channels_in, d_in1, ..., d_inN,
		          channels_out, d_out2, ..., d_outN)`, with the ordering of channels
		          and spatial dimensions matching that of the input. Each entry is the
		          weight between a particular input and output location, similarly to
		          a fully-connected weight matrix.
		    kernel_mask: a float 0/1 mask tensor of shape: `(d_in1, ..., d_inN, 1,
		      d_out2, ..., d_outN, 1)` or `(1, d_in1, ..., d_inN, 1, d_out2, ...,
		      d_outN)`, with the ordering of singleton and spatial dimensions matching
		      that of the input. Mask represents the connectivity pattern of the layer
		      and is
		         precomputed elsewhere based on layer parameters: stride, padding, and
		           the receptive field shape.
		    output_shape: a tuple of (N+2) elements representing the output shape:
		      `(batch_size, channels_out, d_out1, ..., d_outN)` or `(batch_size,
		      d_out1, ..., d_outN, channels_out)`, with the ordering of channels and
		      spatial dimensions matching that of the input.
		
		Returns:
		    Output (N+2)-D tensor with shape `output_shape`.

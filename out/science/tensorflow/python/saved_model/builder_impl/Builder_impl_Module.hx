		Decorator for marking specific function arguments as deprecated.
		
		This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
		called with the deprecated argument. It has the following format:
		
		  Calling <function> (from <module>) with <arg> is deprecated and will be
		  removed after <date>. Instructions for updating:
		    <instructions>
		
		If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
		<function> includes the class name if it is a method.
		
		It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated arguments)' is
		appended to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is
		prepended to the rest of the docstring.
		
		Args:
		  date: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
		    Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
		  instructions: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
		    deprecated function.
		  *deprecated_arg_names_or_tuples: String or 2-Tuple (String,
		    ok_val).  The string is the deprecated argument name.
		    Optionally, an ok-value may be provided.  If the user provided
		    argument equals this value, the warning is suppressed.
		  **kwargs: If `warn_once=False` is passed, every call with a deprecated
		    argument will log a warning. The default behavior is to only warn the
		    first time the function is called with any given deprecated argument.
		    All other kwargs raise `ValueError`.
		
		Returns:
		  Decorated function or method.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, instructions are
		    empty, the deprecated arguments are not present in the function
		    signature, the second element of a deprecated_tuple is not a
		    list, or if a kwarg other than `warn_once` is passed.

	/**
		Get a unique basename to add to the SavedModel if this file is unseen.
		
		Assets come from users as full paths, and we save them out to the
		SavedModel as basenames. In some cases, the basenames collide. Here,
		we dedupe asset basenames by first checking if the file is the same,
		and, if different, generate and return an index-suffixed basename
		that can be used to add the asset to the SavedModel.
		
		Args:
		  asset_filepath: the full path to the asset that is being saved
		  asset_filename_map: a dict of filenames used for saving the asset in
		    the SavedModel to full paths from which the filenames were derived.
		
		Returns:
		  Uniquified filename string if the file is not a duplicate, or the original
		  filename if the file has already been seen and saved.

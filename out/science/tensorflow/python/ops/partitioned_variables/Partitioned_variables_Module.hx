	/**
		Create a list of partitioned variables according to the given `slicing`. (deprecated)
		
		Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
		Instructions for updating:
		Use `tf.get_variable` with a partitioner set.
		
		Currently only one dimension of the full variable can be sliced, and the
		full variable can be reconstructed by the concatenation of the returned
		list along that dimension.
		
		Args:
		  shape: List of integers.  The shape of the full variable.
		  slicing: List of integers.  How to partition the variable.
		    Must be of the same length as `shape`.  Each value
		    indicate how many slices to create in the corresponding
		    dimension.  Presently only one of the values can be more than 1;
		    that is, the variable can only be sliced along one dimension.
		
		    For convenience, The requested number of partitions does not have to
		    divide the corresponding dimension evenly.  If it does not, the
		    shapes of the partitions are incremented by 1 starting from partition
		    0 until all slack is absorbed.  The adjustment rules may change in the
		    future, but as you can save/restore these variables with different
		    slicing specifications this should not be a problem.
		  initializer: A `Tensor` of shape `shape` or a variable initializer
		    function.  If a function, it will be called once for each slice,
		    passing the shape and data type of the slice as parameters.  The
		    function must return a tensor with the same shape as the slice.
		  dtype: Type of the variables. Ignored if `initializer` is a `Tensor`.
		  trainable: If True also add all the variables to the graph collection
		    `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`.
		  collections: List of graph collections keys to add the variables to.
		    Defaults to `[GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES]`.
		  name: Optional name for the full variable.  Defaults to
		    `"PartitionedVariable"` and gets uniquified automatically.
		  reuse: Boolean or `None`; if `True` and name is set, it would reuse
		    previously created variables. if `False` it will create new variables.
		    if `None`, it would inherit the parent scope reuse.
		
		Returns:
		  A list of Variables corresponding to the slicing.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If any of the arguments is malformed.

		Partitioner to specify a fixed number of shards along given axis.
		
		@compatibility(TF2)
		This API is deprecated in TF2. In TF2, partitioner is no longer part of
		the variable declaration via `tf.Variable`.
		[ParameterServer Training]
		(https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/parameter_server_training)
		handles partitioning of variables. The corresponding TF2 partitioner class of
		`fixed_size_partitioner` is
		`tf.distribute.experimental.partitioners.FixedShardsPartitioner`.
		
		Check the [migration guide]
		(https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate#2_use_python_objects_to_track_variables_and_losses)
		on the differences in treatment of variables and losses between TF1 and TF2.
		
		Before:
		
		  ```
		  x = tf.compat.v1.get_variable(
		    "x", shape=(2,), partitioner=tf.compat.v1.fixed_size_partitioner(2)
		  )
		  ```
		After:
		
		  ```
		  partitioner = (
		      tf.distribute.experimental.partitioners.FixedShardsPartitioner(
		          num_shards=2)
		  )
		  strategy = tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy(
		                 cluster_resolver=cluster_resolver,
		                 variable_partitioner=partitioner)
		
		  with strategy.scope():
		    x = tf.Variable([1.0, 2.0])
		  ```

		Args:
		  num_shards: `int`, number of shards to partition variable.
		  axis: `int`, axis to partition on.

		Partitioner to allocate minimum size per slice.
		
		Returns a partitioner that partitions the variable of given shape and dtype
		such that each partition has a minimum of `min_slice_size` slice of the

		`max_partitions`.
		
		Args:
		  max_partitions: Upper bound on the number of partitions. Defaults to 1.

	/**
		Get a partitioner for VariableScope to keep shards below `max_shard_bytes`.
		
		This partitioner will shard a Variable along one axis, attempting to keep
		the maximum shard size below `max_shard_bytes`.  In practice, this is not
		always possible when sharding along only one axis.  When this happens,
		this axis is sharded as much as possible (i.e., every dimension becomes
		a separate shard).
		
		If the partitioner hits the `max_shards` limit, then each shard may end up
		larger than `max_shard_bytes`. By default `max_shards` equals `None` and no
		limit on the number of shards is enforced.
		
		One reasonable value for `max_shard_bytes` is `(64 << 20) - 1`, or almost
		`64MB`, to keep below the protobuf byte limit.
		
		Args:
		  max_shard_bytes: The maximum size any given shard is allowed to be.
		  axis: The axis to partition along.  Default: outermost axis.
		  bytes_per_string_element: If the `Variable` is of type string, this provides
		    an estimate of how large each scalar in the `Variable` is.
		  max_shards: The maximum number of shards in int created taking precedence
		    over `max_shard_bytes`.
		
		Returns:
		  A partition function usable as the `partitioner` argument to
		  `variable_scope` and `get_variable`.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If any of the byte counts are non-positive.

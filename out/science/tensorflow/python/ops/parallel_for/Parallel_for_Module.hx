	/**
		Computes and stacks jacobians of `output[i,...]` w.r.t. `input[i,...]`.
		
		e.g.
		x = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=tf.float32)
		y = x * x
		jacobian = batch_jacobian(y, x)
		# => [[[2,  0], [0,  4]], [[6,  0], [0,  8]]]
		
		Args:
		  output: A tensor with shape [b, y1, ..., y_n]. `output[i,...]` should
		    only depend on `inp[i,...]`.
		  inp: A tensor with shape [b, x1, ..., x_m]
		  use_pfor: If true, uses pfor for computing the Jacobian. Else uses a
		    tf.while_loop.
		  parallel_iterations: A knob to control how many iterations are vectorized
		    and dispatched in parallel. The default value of None, when use_pfor is
		    true, corresponds to vectorizing all the iterations. When use_pfor is
		    false, the default value of None corresponds to parallel_iterations=10.
		    This knob can be used to control the total memory usage.
		
		Returns:
		  A tensor `t` with shape [b, y_1, ..., y_n, x1, ..., x_m] where `t[i, ...]`
		  is the jacobian of `output[i, ...]` w.r.t. `inp[i, ...]`, i.e. stacked
		  per-example jacobians.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: if first dimension of `output` and `inp` do not match.

		Computes jacobian of `output` w.r.t. `inputs`.
		
		Args:

	/**
		Equivalent to running `loop_fn` `iters` times and stacking the outputs.
		
		`pfor` has functionality similar to `for_loop`, i.e. running `loop_fn` `iters`
		times, with input from 0 to `iters - 1`, and stacking corresponding output of
		each iteration. However the implementation does not use a `tf.while_loop`.
		Instead it adds new operations to the graph that collectively compute the same
		value as what running `loop_fn` in a loop would compute.
		
		
		This is an experimental feature and currently has a lot of limitations:
		  - There should be no data dependency between the different iterations. For
		    example, a future iteration should not depend on a value or side-effect of
		    a previous iteration.
		  - Stateful kernels may mostly not be supported since these often imply a
		    data dependency or ordering of the iterations. We do support a limited set
		    of such stateful kernels though (like RandomFoo, Variable operations like
		    reads, etc).
		  - Conversion works only on a limited set of kernels for which a converter
		    has been registered.
		  - `loop_fn` has limited support for control flow operations. `tf.cond` in
		    particular is not supported.
		  - `loop_fn` should return nested structure of Tensors or Operations. However
		    if an Operation is returned, it should have zero outputs.
		  - The shape and dtype of `loop_fn` outputs should not depend on the input
		    to loop_fn.
		
		Args:
		  loop_fn: A function that takes an int32 scalar tf.Tensor object representing
		    the iteration number, and optionally a keyword argument `pfor_config` set
		    to a PForConfig object. It returns a possibly nested structure of Tensor
		    or Operation objects. Note that if setting `parallel_iterations` argument
		    to something other than None, `loop_fn` may be called more than once
		    during graph construction. So it may need to avoid mutating global state.
		  iters: Number of iterations for which to run `loop_fn`.
		  fallback_to_while_loop: If true, on failing to vectorize an operation, pfor
		    fallbacks to using a `tf.while_loop` to dispatch the iterations.
		  parallel_iterations: A knob to control how many iterations are vectorized
		    and dispatched in parallel. The default value of None corresponds to
		    vectorizing all the iterations.  If `parallel_iterations` is smaller than
		    `iters`, then chunks of at most that many iterations are dispatched in
		    sequence. This knob can be used to control the total memory usage.
		
		Returns:
		  Returns a nested structure of stacked tensor objects with the same nested
		  structure as the output of `loop_fn`.
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If parallel_iterations is not None and not an integer > 1.

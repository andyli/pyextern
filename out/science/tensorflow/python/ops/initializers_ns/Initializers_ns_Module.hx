		Returns an Op that initializes a list of variables.
		
		After you launch the graph in a session, you can run the returned Op to
		initialize all the variables in `var_list`. This Op runs all the
		initializers of the variables in `var_list` in parallel.
		
		Calling `initialize_variables()` is equivalent to passing the list of
		initializers to `Group()`.
		
		If `var_list` is empty, however, the function still returns an Op that can
		be run. That Op just has no effect.

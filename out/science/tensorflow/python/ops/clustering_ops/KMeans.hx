		Creates an object for generating KMeans clustering graph.
		
		This class implements the following variants of K-means algorithm:
		
		If use_mini_batch is False, it runs standard full batch K-means. Each step
		runs a single iteration of K-Means. This step can be run sharded across
		multiple workers by passing a list of sharded inputs to this class. Note
		however that a single step needs to process the full input at once.
		
		If use_mini_batch is True, it runs a generalization of the mini-batch
		K-means algorithm. It runs multiple iterations, where each iteration is
		composed of mini_batch_steps_per_iteration steps. Two copies of cluster
		centers are maintained: one that is updated at the end of each iteration,
		and one that is updated every step. The first copy is used to compute
		cluster allocations for each step, and for inference, while the second copy
		is the one updated each step using the mini-batch update rule. After each
		iteration is complete, this second copy is copied back the first copy.
		
		Note that for use_mini_batch=True, when mini_batch_steps_per_iteration=1,
		the algorithm reduces to the standard mini-batch algorithm. Also by setting
		mini_batch_steps_per_iteration = num_inputs / batch_size, the algorithm
		becomes an asynchronous version of the full-batch algorithm. Note however
		that there is no guarantee by this implementation that each input is seen
		exactly once per iteration. Also, different updates are applied
		asynchronously without locking. So this asynchronous version may not behave
		exactly like a full-batch version.
		
		Args:
		  inputs: An input tensor or list of input tensors. It is assumed that the
		    data points have been previously randomly permuted.
		  num_clusters: An integer tensor specifying the number of clusters. This
		    argument is ignored if initial_clusters is a tensor or numpy array.
		  initial_clusters: Specifies the clusters used during initialization. One
		    of the following: - a tensor or numpy array with the initial cluster
		      centers. - a function f(inputs, k) that returns up to k centers from
		      `inputs`.
		    - "random": Choose centers randomly from `inputs`.
		    - "kmeans_plus_plus": Use kmeans++ to choose centers from `inputs`.
		    - "kmc2": Use the fast k-MC2 algorithm to choose centers from `inputs`.
		      In the last three cases, one batch of `inputs` may not yield
		      `num_clusters` centers, in which case initialization will require
		      multiple batches until enough centers are chosen. In the case of
		      "random" or "kmeans_plus_plus", if the input size is <= `num_clusters`
		      then the entire batch is chosen to be cluster centers.
		  distance_metric: Distance metric used for clustering. Supported options:
		    "squared_euclidean", "cosine".
		  use_mini_batch: If true, use the mini-batch k-means algorithm. Else assume
		    full batch.
		  mini_batch_steps_per_iteration: Number of steps after which the updated
		    cluster centers are synced back to a master copy.
		  random_seed: Seed for PRNG used to initialize seeds.
		  kmeans_plus_plus_num_retries: For each point that is sampled during
		    kmeans++ initialization, this parameter specifies the number of
		    additional points to draw from the current distribution before selecting
		    the best. If a negative value is specified, a heuristic is used to
		    sample O(log(num_to_sample)) additional points.
		  kmc2_chain_length: Determines how many candidate points are used by the
		    k-MC2 algorithm to produce one new cluster centers. If a (mini-)batch
		    contains less points, one new cluster center is generated from the
		    (mini-)batch.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: An invalid argument was passed to initial_clusters or
		    distance_metric.

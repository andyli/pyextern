	/**
		Applies sparse `updates` to individual values or slices within a given
		
		variable according to `indices`.
		
		`ref` is a `Tensor` with rank `P` and `indices` is a `Tensor` of rank `Q`.
		
		`indices` must be integer tensor, containing indices into `ref`.
		It must be shape \\([d_0, ..., d_{Q-2}, K]\\) where `0 < K <= P`.
		
		The innermost dimension of `indices` (with length `K`) corresponds to
		indices into elements (if `K = P`) or slices (if `K < P`) along the `K`th
		dimension of `ref`.
		
		`updates` is `Tensor` of rank `Q-1+P-K` with shape:
		
		$$[d_0, ..., d_{Q-2}, ref.shape[K], ..., ref.shape[P-1]].$$
		
		For example, say we want to update 4 scattered elements to a rank-1 tensor to
		8 elements. In Python, that update would look like this:
		
		```python
		    ref = tf.Variable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
		    indices = tf.constant([[4], [3], [1] ,[7]])
		    updates = tf.constant([9, 10, 11, 12])
		    update = tf.scatter_nd_update(ref, indices, updates)
		    with tf.Session() as sess:
		      print sess.run(update)
		```
		
		The resulting update to ref would look like this:
		
		    [1, 11, 3, 10, 9, 6, 7, 12]
		
		See `tf.scatter_nd` for more details about how to make updates to
		slices.
		
		See also `tf.scatter_update` and `tf.batch_scatter_update`.
		
		Args:
		  ref: A mutable `Tensor`. A mutable Tensor. Should be from a Variable node.
		  indices: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.
		    A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64.
		    A tensor of indices into ref.
		  updates: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `ref`.
		    A Tensor. Must have the same type as ref. A tensor of updated
		    values to add to ref.
		  use_locking: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`.

		    be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined,
		    but may exhibit less contention.

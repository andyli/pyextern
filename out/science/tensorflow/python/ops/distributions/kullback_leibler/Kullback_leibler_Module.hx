		Computes the (Shannon) cross entropy. (deprecated)
		
		Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2019-01-01.
		Instructions for updating:
		The TensorFlow Distributions library has moved to TensorFlow Probability (https://github.com/tensorflow/probability). You should update all references to use `tfp.distributions` instead of `tf.distributions`.
		
		Denote two distributions by `P` (`ref`) and `Q` (`other`). Assuming `P, Q`
		are absolutely continuous with respect to one another and permit densities
		`p(x) dr(x)` and `q(x) dr(x)`, (Shanon) cross entropy is defined as:
		
		```none
		H[P, Q] = E_p[-log q(X)] = -int_F p(x) log q(x) dr(x)
		```
		
		where `F` denotes the support of the random variable `X ~ P`.
		
		Args:
		  ref: `tfd.Distribution` instance.
		  other: `tfd.Distribution` instance.
		  allow_nan_stats: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`,
		    statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to
		    indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised
		    if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
		  name: Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.
		
		Returns:
		  cross_entropy: `ref.dtype` `Tensor` with shape `[B1, ..., Bn]`
		    representing `n` different calculations of (Shanon) cross entropy.

		Get the KL-divergence KL(distribution_a || distribution_b). (deprecated)
		
		Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2019-01-01.
		Instructions for updating:
		The TensorFlow Distributions library has moved to TensorFlow Probability (https://github.com/tensorflow/probability). You should update all references to use `tfp.distributions` instead of `tf.distributions`.
		
		If there is no KL method registered specifically for `type(distribution_a)`
		and `type(distribution_b)`, then the class hierarchies of these types are
		searched.
		
		If one KL method is registered between any pairs of classes in these two
		parent hierarchies, it is used.
		
		If more than one such registered method exists, the method whose registered
		classes have the shortest sum MRO paths to the input types is used.
		
		If more than one such shortest path exists, the first method
		identified in the search is used (favoring a shorter MRO distance to
		`type(distribution_a)`).
		
		Args:
		  distribution_a: The first distribution.
		  distribution_b: The second distribution.
		  allow_nan_stats: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`,
		    statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to
		    indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised
		    if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
		  name: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.
		
		Returns:
		  A Tensor with the batchwise KL-divergence between `distribution_a`
		  and `distribution_b`.
		
		Raises:
		  NotImplementedError: If no KL method is defined for distribution types
		    of `distribution_a` and `distribution_b`.

		as an additional cluster center.
		
		Args:
		  distances: A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
		    Vector with squared distances to the closest previously sampled cluster center
		    for each candidate point.
		  seed: A `Tensor` of type `int64`.
		    Scalar. Seed for initializing the random number generator.

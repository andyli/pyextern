		**Example**

		variable will be automatically saved to the checkpoint. The implementation

		Returns a new object restored by the SavedModel.
		
		Trackable classes decorated with `register_serializable` should overwrite

		Example:
		
		```
		def _serialize_to_proto(self, **unused_kwargs):
		  return Message(name="a")
		
		@classmethod
		def _deserialize_from_proto(cls, proto, **unused_kwargs):

		This function is only used by the Python API. C++ and TensorFlow Serving do
		not have access to your registered class and cannot execute any of the
		non-tf.functions attached to the Python class. However, all signatures and
		tf.functions are still accessible.
		
		**Avoid creating duplicate trackables**
		
		SavedModel is saved by recursively gathering all of the trackables and their
		children. SavedModel loading reverses those steps by creating all
		trackables, then reconnecting the children trackables to their parents using
		`Trackable._add_trackable_child`.
		
		That means that if `_deserialize_from_proto` calls the `__init__` function,
		which creates all of the children trackables, then those children end up
		being created *twice*.
		
		To avoid this, structure your code so that Trackables are not created
		when deserialized from SavedModel:
		
		```
		@register_serializable()
		class Serializable(trackable):
		  def __init __(self, from_proto=False):
		    create_non_trackable_objects()
		    if not from_proto:
		      create_variables_and_other_trackables()
		
		  def _deserialize_from_proto(cls, **kwargs):
		    return cls(from_proto=True)
		
		  def _add_trackable_child(self, name, value):
		    self.__setattr__(name, value)
		```
		
		Args:
		  **kwargs: Keyword arguments passed to the object when loading. As of now,
		    the only supported kwarg is:
		    * proto: A `google.protobuf.Any` proto read from the SavedModel.
		
		Returns:

		Returns a dictionary of values to checkpoint with this object.
		
		Keys in the returned dictionary are local to this object and in a separate
		namespace from dependencies. Values may either be `SaveableObject` factories
		or variables easily converted to `SaveableObject`s (as in
		`tf.compat.v1.train.Saver`'s
		`var_list` constructor argument).
		
		`SaveableObjects` have a name set, which Trackable needs to generate
		itself. So rather than returning `SaveableObjects` directly, this method
		should return a dictionary of callables which take `name` arguments and
		return `SaveableObjects` with that name.
		
		If this object may also be passed to the global-name-based
		`tf.compat.v1.train.Saver`,
		the returned callables should have a default value for their name argument
		(i.e. be callable with no arguments).
		
		Returned values must be saved only by this object; if any value may be
		shared, it should instead be a dependency. For example, variable objects
		save their own values with the key `VARIABLE_VALUE_KEY`, but objects which
		reference variables simply add a dependency.
		
		Returns:
		  The dictionary mapping attribute names to `SaveableObject` factories

		`trackable` and its dependencies are restored. The restorations are

		`_track_trackable` is more appropriate for adding a

		Creates a `Saver`.
		
		The constructor adds ops to save and restore variables.
		
		`var_list` specifies the variables that will be saved and restored. It can
		be passed as a `dict` or a list:
		
		* A `dict` of names to variables: The keys are the names that will be
		  used to save or restore the variables in the checkpoint files.
		* A list of variables: The variables will be keyed with their op name in
		  the checkpoint files.
		
		For example:
		
		```python
		v1 = tf.Variable(..., name='v1')
		v2 = tf.Variable(..., name='v2')
		
		# Pass the variables as a dict:
		saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver({'v1': v1, 'v2': v2})
		
		# Or pass them as a list.
		saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver([v1, v2])
		# Passing a list is equivalent to passing a dict with the variable op names
		# as keys:
		saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver({v.op.name: v for v in [v1, v2]})
		```
		
		Note: the newer `AutoTrackable` API is not supported by `Saver`. In this
		case, the `tf.train.Checkpoint` class should be used.
		
		The optional `reshape` argument, if `True`, allows restoring a variable from
		a save file where the variable had a different shape, but the same number
		of elements and type.  This is useful if you have reshaped a variable and
		want to reload it from an older checkpoint.
		
		The optional `sharded` argument, if `True`, instructs the saver to shard
		checkpoints per device.
		
		Args:
		  var_list: A list of `Variable`/`SaveableObject`, or a dictionary mapping
		    names to `SaveableObject`s. If `None`, defaults to the list of all
		    saveable objects.
		  reshape: If `True`, allows restoring parameters from a checkpoint where
		    the variables have a different shape.
		  sharded: If `True`, shard the checkpoints, one per device.
		  max_to_keep: Maximum number of recent checkpoints to keep. Defaults to 5.
		  keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours: How often to keep checkpoints. Defaults to
		    10,000 hours.
		  name: String.  Optional name to use as a prefix when adding operations.
		  restore_sequentially: A `Bool`, which if true, causes restore of different
		    variables to happen sequentially within each device.  This can lower
		    memory usage when restoring very large models.
		  saver_def: Optional `SaverDef` proto to use instead of running the
		    builder. This is only useful for specialty code that wants to recreate a
		    `Saver` object for a previously built `Graph` that had a `Saver`. The
		    `saver_def` proto should be the one returned by the `as_saver_def()`
		    call of the `Saver` that was created for that `Graph`.
		  builder: Optional `SaverBuilder` to use if a `saver_def` was not provided.
		    Defaults to `BulkSaverBuilder()`.
		  defer_build: If `True`, defer adding the save and restore ops to the
		    `build()` call. In that case `build()` should be called before
		    finalizing the graph or using the saver.
		  allow_empty: If `False` (default) raise an error if there are no variables
		    in the graph. Otherwise, construct the saver anyway and make it a no-op.
		  write_version: controls what format to use when saving checkpoints.  It
		    also affects certain filepath matching logic.  The V2 format is the
		    recommended choice: it is much more optimized than V1 in terms of memory
		      required and latency incurred during restore.  Regardless of this
		      flag, the Saver is able to restore from both V2 and V1 checkpoints.
		  pad_step_number: if True, pads the global step number in the checkpoint
		    filepaths to some fixed width (8 by default).  This is turned off by
		    default.
		  save_relative_paths: If `True`, will write relative paths to the
		    checkpoint state file. This is needed if the user wants to copy the
		    checkpoint directory and reload from the copied directory.
		  filename: If known at graph construction time, filename used for variable
		    loading/saving.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: If `var_list` is invalid.
		  ValueError: If any of the keys or values in `var_list` are not unique.
		  RuntimeError: If eager execution is enabled and`var_list` does not specify
		    a list of variables to save.
		
		@compatibility(eager)
		When eager execution is enabled, `var_list` must specify a `list` or `dict`
		of variables to save. Otherwise, a `RuntimeError` will be raised.
		
		Although Saver works in some cases when executing eagerly, it is
		fragile. Please switch to `tf.train.Checkpoint` or
		`tf.keras.Model.save_weights`, which perform a more robust object-based
		saving. These APIs will load checkpoints written by `Saver`.

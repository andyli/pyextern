		Helper function for pack_nest_as.
		
		Args:
		  structure: Substructure (tuple of elements and/or tuples) to mimic
		  flat: Flattened values to output substructure for.
		  index: Index at which to start reading from flat.
		
		Returns:
		  The tuple (new_index, child), where:
		    * new_index - the updated index into `flat` having processed `structure`.
		    * packed - the subset of `flat` corresponding to `structure`,
		               having started at `index`, and packed into the same nested
		               format.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: if `structure` contains more elements than `flat`
		    (assuming indexing starts from `index`).

		  *inputs: arbitrarily nested combination of objects that are compatible with

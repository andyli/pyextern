		Recreates a Graph saved in a `MetaGraphDef` proto.
		
		This function takes a `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer as input. If
		the argument is a file containing a `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer ,
		it constructs a protocol buffer from the file content. The function
		then adds all the nodes from the `graph_def` field to the
		current graph, recreates all the collections, and returns a saver
		constructed from the `saver_def` field.
		
		In combination with `export_meta_graph()`, this function can be used to
		
		* Serialize a graph along with other Python objects such as `QueueRunner`,
		  `Variable` into a `MetaGraphDef`.
		
		* Restart training from a saved graph and checkpoints.
		
		* Run inference from a saved graph and checkpoints.
		
		```Python
		...
		# Create a saver.
		saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver(...variables...)
		# Remember the training_op we want to run by adding it to a collection.
		tf.compat.v1.add_to_collection('train_op', train_op)
		sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
		for step in xrange(1000000):
		    sess.run(train_op)
		    if step % 1000 == 0:
		        # Saves checkpoint, which by default also exports a meta_graph
		        # named 'my-model-global_step.meta'.
		        saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=step)
		```
		
		Later we can continue training from this saved `meta_graph` without building
		the model from scratch.
		
		```Python
		with tf.Session() as sess:
		  new_saver =
		  tf.train.import_meta_graph('my-save-dir/my-model-10000.meta')
		  new_saver.restore(sess, 'my-save-dir/my-model-10000')
		  # tf.get_collection() returns a list. In this example we only want
		  # the first one.
		  train_op = tf.get_collection('train_op')[0]
		  for step in xrange(1000000):
		    sess.run(train_op)
		```
		
		NOTE: Restarting training from saved `meta_graph` only works if the
		device assignments have not changed.
		
		Example:
		Variables, placeholders, and independent operations can also be stored, as
		shown in the following example.
		
		```Python
		# Saving contents and operations.
		v1 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name="v1")
		v2 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name="v2")
		v3 = tf.math.multiply(v1, v2)
		vx = tf.Variable(10.0, name="vx")
		v4 = tf.add(v3, vx, name="v4")
		saver = tf.train.Saver([vx])
		sess = tf.Session()
		sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
		sess.run(vx.assign(tf.add(vx, vx)))
		result = sess.run(v4, feed_dict={v1:12.0, v2:3.3})
		print(result)
		saver.save(sess, "./model_ex1")
		```
		
		Later this model can be restored and contents loaded.
		
		```Python
		# Restoring variables and running operations.
		saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph("./model_ex1.meta")
		sess = tf.Session()
		saver.restore(sess, "./model_ex1")
		result = sess.run("v4:0", feed_dict={"v1:0": 12.0, "v2:0": 3.3})
		print(result)
		```
		
		Args:
		  meta_graph_or_file: `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer or filename (including
		    the path) containing a `MetaGraphDef`.

		    or `Tensor` during import.

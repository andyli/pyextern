		Args:
		  graph: A `Graph`.  The graph that the model will use.  Defaults to the
		    default `Graph`.  The supervisor may add operations to the graph before
		    creating a session, but the graph should not be modified by the caller
		    after passing it to the supervisor.
		  ready_op: 1-D string `Tensor`.  This tensor is evaluated by supervisors in
		    `prepare_or_wait_for_session()` to check if the model is ready to use.
		    The model is considered ready if it returns an empty array.  Defaults to
		    the tensor returned from `tf.compat.v1.report_uninitialized_variables()`
		    If `None`, the model is not checked for readiness.
		  ready_for_local_init_op: 1-D string `Tensor`.  This tensor is evaluated by
		    supervisors in `prepare_or_wait_for_session()` to check if the model is
		    ready to run the local_init_op. The model is considered ready if it
		    returns an empty array. Defaults to `None`. If `None`, the model is not
		    checked for readiness before running local_init_op.
		  is_chief: If True, create a chief supervisor in charge of initializing and
		    restoring the model.  If False, create a supervisor that relies on a
		    chief supervisor for inits and restore.
		  init_op: `Operation`.  Used by chief supervisors to initialize the model
		    when it can not be recovered.  Defaults to an `Operation` that
		    initializes all global variables.  If `None`, no initialization is done
		    automatically unless you pass a value for `init_fn`, see below.
		  init_feed_dict: A dictionary that maps `Tensor` objects to feed values.
		    This feed dictionary will be used when `init_op` is evaluated.
		  local_init_op: `Operation`. Used by all supervisors to run initializations
		    that should run for every new supervisor instance. By default these are
		    table initializers and initializers for local variables. If `None`, no
		    further per supervisor-instance initialization is done automatically.
		  logdir: A string.  Optional path to a directory where to checkpoint the
		    model and log events for the visualizer.  Used by chief supervisors. The
		    directory will be created if it does not exist.
		  summary_op: An `Operation` that returns a Summary for the event logs. Used
		    by chief supervisors if a `logdir` was specified.  Defaults to the
		    operation returned from summary.merge_all().  If `None`, summaries are
		    not computed automatically.
		  saver: A Saver object.  Used by chief supervisors if a `logdir` was
		    specified.  Defaults to the saved returned by Saver(). If `None`, the
		    model is not saved automatically.
		  global_step: An integer Tensor of size 1 that counts steps.  The value
		    from 'global_step' is used in summaries and checkpoint filenames.
		    Default to the op named 'global_step' in the graph if it exists, is of
		    rank 1, size 1, and of type tf.int32 or tf.int64.  If `None` the global
		    step is not recorded in summaries and checkpoint files.  Used by chief
		    supervisors if a `logdir` was specified.
		  save_summaries_secs: Number of seconds between the computation of
		    summaries for the event log.  Defaults to 120 seconds.  Pass 0 to
		    disable summaries.
		  save_model_secs: Number of seconds between the creation of model
		    checkpoints.  Defaults to 600 seconds.  Pass 0 to disable checkpoints.
		  recovery_wait_secs: Number of seconds between checks that the model is
		    ready.  Used by supervisors when waiting for a chief supervisor to
		    initialize or restore the model.  Defaults to 30 seconds.
		  stop_grace_secs: Grace period, in seconds, given to running threads to
		    stop when `stop()` is called.  Defaults to 120 seconds.
		  checkpoint_basename: The basename for checkpoint saving.
		  session_manager: `SessionManager`, which manages Session creation and
		    recovery. If it is `None`, a default `SessionManager` will be created
		    with the set of arguments passed in for backwards compatibility.
		  summary_writer: `SummaryWriter` to use or `USE_DEFAULT`.  Can be `None` to
		    indicate that no summaries should be written.
		  init_fn: Optional callable used to initialize the model. Called after the
		    optional `init_op` is called.  The callable must accept one argument,
		    the session being initialized.
		  local_init_run_options: RunOptions to be passed as the SessionManager
		    local_init_run_options parameter.
		
		Returns:
		  A `Supervisor`.
		
		Raises:
		  RuntimeError: If called with eager execution enabled.

		Returns a context manager for a managed session.
		
		This context manager creates and automatically recovers a session.  It
		optionally starts the standard services that handle checkpoints and
		summaries.  It monitors exceptions raised from the `with` block or from the
		services and stops the supervisor as needed.
		
		The context manager is typically used as follows:
		
		```python
		def train():
		  sv = tf.compat.v1.train.Supervisor(...)
		  with sv.managed_session(<master>) as sess:
		    for step in xrange(..):
		      if sv.should_stop():
		        break
		      sess.run(<my training op>)
		      ...do other things needed at each training step...
		```
		
		An exception raised from the `with` block or one of the service threads is
		raised again when the block exits.  This is done after stopping all threads
		and closing the session.  For example, an `AbortedError` exception, raised
		in case of preemption of one of the workers in a distributed model, is
		raised again when the block exits.
		
		If you want to retry the training loop in case of preemption you can do it
		as follows:
		
		```python
		def main(...):
		  while True
		    try:
		      train()
		    except tf.errors.Aborted:
		      pass
		```
		
		As a special case, exceptions used for control flow, such as
		`OutOfRangeError` which reports that input queues are exhausted, are not
		raised again from the `with` block: they indicate a clean termination of
		the training loop and are considered normal termination.
		
		Args:
		  master: name of the TensorFlow master to use.  See the
		    `tf.compat.v1.Session` constructor for how this is interpreted.
		  config: Optional `ConfigProto` proto used to configure the session. Passed
		    as-is to create the session.
		  start_standard_services: Whether to start the standard services, such as
		    checkpoint, summary and step counter.
		  close_summary_writer: Whether to close the summary writer when closing the
		    session.  Defaults to True.
		
		Returns:
		  A context manager that yields a `Session` restored from the latest
		  checkpoint or initialized from scratch if not checkpoint exists.  The
		  session is closed when the `with` block exits.

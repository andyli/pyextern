		Read `SparseTensors` from a `SparseTensorsMap` and concatenate them.
		
		The input `sparse_handles` must be a string matrix of shape `[N, 1]` where
		`N` is the minibatch size and the rows correspond to packed outputs of
		`add_sparse_to_tensors_map`.  The ranks of the original `SparseTensor` objects
		must all match.  When the final `SparseTensor` is created, it has rank one
		higher than the ranks of the incoming `SparseTensor` objects (they have been
		concatenated along a new row dimension).
		
		The output `SparseTensor` object's shape values for all dimensions but the
		first are the max across the input `SparseTensor` objects' shape values
		for the corresponding dimensions.  Its first shape value is `N`, the minibatch
		size.
		
		The input `SparseTensor` objects' indices are assumed ordered in
		standard lexicographic order.  If this is not the case, after this
		step run `sparse.reorder` to restore index ordering.
		
		For example, if the serialized input is a `[2, 3]` matrix representing two
		original `SparseTensor` objects:
		
		    index = [ 0]
		            [10]
		            [20]
		    values = [1, 2, 3]

		and
		
		    index = [ 2]
		            [10]
		    values = [4, 5]
		    shape = [30]
		
		then the final deserialized `SparseTensor` will be:
		
		    index = [0  0]
		            [0 10]
		            [0 20]
		            [1  2]
		            [1 10]
		    values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		    shape = [2 50]
		
		Args:
		  sparse_map_op: The `Operation` that created the original handles.
		    Usually this is, e.g., `add_sparse_to_tensors_map(...).op`.
		  sparse_handles: 2-D `Tensor` of type `string` of shape `[N, 1]`.
		    The serialized and packed `SparseTensor` objects.
		  rank: (optional) Python int, the rank of the `SparseTensor` objects.
		  name: A name prefix for the returned tensors (optional)
		
		Returns:
		  A `SparseTensor` representing the deserialized `SparseTensor`s,

		Creates batches of tensors in `tensors`. (deprecated)
		
		Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
		Instructions for updating:
		Queue-based input pipelines have been replaced by `tf.data`. Use `tf.data.Dataset.batch(batch_size)` (or `padded_batch(...)` if `dynamic_pad=True`).
		
		The argument `tensors` can be a list or a dictionary of tensors.
		The value returned by the function will be of the same type
		as `tensors`.
		
		This function is implemented using a queue. A `QueueRunner` for the
		queue is added to the current `Graph`'s `QUEUE_RUNNER` collection.
		
		If `enqueue_many` is `False`, `tensors` is assumed to represent a single
		example.  An input tensor with shape `[x, y, z]` will be output as a tensor
		with shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.
		
		If `enqueue_many` is `True`, `tensors` is assumed to represent a batch of
		examples, where the first dimension is indexed by example, and all members of
		`tensors` should have the same size in the first dimension.  If an input
		tensor has shape `[*, x, y, z]`, the output will have shape `[batch_size, x,
		y, z]`.  The `capacity` argument controls the how long the prefetching is
		allowed to grow the queues.
		
		The returned operation is a dequeue operation and will throw
		`tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` if the input queue is exhausted. If this
		operation is feeding another input queue, its queue runner will catch
		this exception, however, if this operation is used in your main thread
		you are responsible for catching this yourself.
		
		*N.B.:* If `dynamic_pad` is `False`, you must ensure that either
		(i) the `shapes` argument is passed, or (ii) all of the tensors in
		`tensors` must have fully-defined shapes. `ValueError` will be
		raised if neither of these conditions holds.
		
		If `dynamic_pad` is `True`, it is sufficient that the *rank* of the
		tensors is known, but individual dimensions may have shape `None`.
		In this case, for each enqueue the dimensions with value `None`
		may have a variable length; upon dequeue, the output tensors will be padded
		on the right to the maximum shape of the tensors in the current minibatch.
		For numbers, this padding takes value 0.  For strings, this padding is
		the empty string.  See `PaddingFIFOQueue` for more info.
		
		If `allow_smaller_final_batch` is `True`, a smaller batch value than
		`batch_size` is returned when the queue is closed and there are not enough
		elements to fill the batch, otherwise the pending elements are discarded.
		In addition, all output tensors' static shapes, as accessed via the
		`shape` property will have a first `Dimension` value of `None`, and
		operations that depend on fixed batch_size would fail.
		
		Args:
		  tensors: The list or dictionary of tensors to enqueue.
		  batch_size: The new batch size pulled from the queue.
		  num_threads: The number of threads enqueuing `tensors`.  The batching will
		    be nondeterministic if `num_threads > 1`.
		  capacity: An integer. The maximum number of elements in the queue.
		  enqueue_many: Whether each tensor in `tensors` is a single example.
		  shapes: (Optional) The shapes for each example.  Defaults to the
		    inferred shapes for `tensors`.
		  dynamic_pad: Boolean.  Allow variable dimensions in input shapes.
		    The given dimensions are padded upon dequeue so that tensors within a
		    batch have the same shapes.
		  allow_smaller_final_batch: (Optional) Boolean. If `True`, allow the final
		    batch to be smaller if there are insufficient items left in the queue.
		  shared_name: (Optional). If set, this queue will be shared under the given
		    name across multiple sessions.
		  name: (Optional) A name for the operations.
		
		Returns:
		  A list or dictionary of tensors with the same types as `tensors` (except if
		  the input is a list of one element, then it returns a tensor, not a list).
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If the `shapes` are not specified, and cannot be
		    inferred from the elements of `tensors`.

		Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
		Instructions for updating:
		Queue-based input pipelines have been replaced by `tf.data`. Use `tf.data.Dataset.shuffle(min_after_dequeue).batch(batch_size)`.
		
		This function adds the following to the current `Graph`:
		
		* A shuffling queue into which tensors from `tensors` are enqueued.
		* A `dequeue_many` operation to create batches from the queue.
		* A `QueueRunner` to `QUEUE_RUNNER` collection, to enqueue the tensors
		  from `tensors`.
		
		If `enqueue_many` is `False`, `tensors` is assumed to represent a
		single example.  An input tensor with shape `[x, y, z]` will be output
		as a tensor with shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.
		
		If `enqueue_many` is `True`, `tensors` is assumed to represent a
		batch of examples, where the first dimension is indexed by example,
		and all members of `tensors` should have the same size in the
		first dimension.  If an input tensor has shape `[*, x, y, z]`, the
		output will have shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.
		
		The `capacity` argument controls the how long the prefetching is allowed to
		grow the queues.
		
		The returned operation is a dequeue operation and will throw
		`tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` if the input queue is exhausted. If this
		operation is feeding another input queue, its queue runner will catch
		this exception, however, if this operation is used in your main thread
		you are responsible for catching this yourself.
		
		For example:
		
		```python
		# Creates batches of 32 images and 32 labels.
		image_batch, label_batch = tf.compat.v1.train.shuffle_batch(
		      [single_image, single_label],
		      batch_size=32,
		      num_threads=4,
		      capacity=50000,
		      min_after_dequeue=10000)
		```
		
		*N.B.:* You must ensure that either (i) the `shapes` argument is
		passed, or (ii) all of the tensors in `tensors` must have
		fully-defined shapes. `ValueError` will be raised if neither of
		these conditions holds.
		
		If `allow_smaller_final_batch` is `True`, a smaller batch value than
		`batch_size` is returned when the queue is closed and there are not enough
		elements to fill the batch, otherwise the pending elements are discarded.
		In addition, all output tensors' static shapes, as accessed via the
		`shape` property will have a first `Dimension` value of `None`, and
		operations that depend on fixed batch_size would fail.
		
		Args:
		  tensors: The list or dictionary of tensors to enqueue.
		  batch_size: The new batch size pulled from the queue.
		  capacity: An integer. The maximum number of elements in the queue.
		  min_after_dequeue: Minimum number elements in the queue after a
		    dequeue, used to ensure a level of mixing of elements.
		  num_threads: The number of threads enqueuing `tensor_list`.
		  seed: Seed for the random shuffling within the queue.

	/**
		Evaluates the model at the given checkpoint path.
		
		During a single evaluation, the `eval_ops` is run until the session is
		interrupted or requested to finish. This is typically requested via a
		`tf.contrib.training.StopAfterNEvalsHook` which results in `eval_ops` running
		the requested number of times.
		
		Optionally, a user can pass in `final_ops`, a single `Tensor`, a list of
		`Tensors` or a dictionary from names to `Tensors`. The `final_ops` is
		evaluated a single time after `eval_ops` has finished running and the fetched
		values of `final_ops` are returned. If `final_ops` is left as `None`, then
		`None` is returned.
		
		One may also consider using a `tf.contrib.training.SummaryAtEndHook` to record
		summaries after the `eval_ops` have run. If `eval_ops` is `None`, the
		summaries run immediately after the model checkpoint has been restored.
		
		Note that `evaluate_once` creates a local variable used to track the number of
		evaluations run via `tf.contrib.training.get_or_create_eval_step`.
		Consequently, if a custom local init op is provided via a `scaffold`, the
		caller should ensure that the local init op also initializes the eval step.
		
		Args:
		  checkpoint_path: The path to a checkpoint to use for evaluation.
		  master: The BNS address of the TensorFlow master.
		  scaffold: An tf.compat.v1.train.Scaffold instance for initializing variables
		    and restoring variables. Note that `scaffold.init_fn` is used by the
		    function to restore the checkpoint. If you supply a custom init_fn, then
		    it must also take care of restoring the model from its checkpoint.
		  eval_ops: A single `Tensor`, a list of `Tensors` or a dictionary of names to
		    `Tensors`, which is run until the session is requested to stop, commonly
		    done by a `tf.contrib.training.StopAfterNEvalsHook`.
		  feed_dict: The feed dictionary to use when executing the `eval_ops`.
		  final_ops: A single `Tensor`, a list of `Tensors` or a dictionary of names
		    to `Tensors`.
		  final_ops_feed_dict: A feed dictionary to use when evaluating `final_ops`.
		  hooks: List of `tf.estimator.SessionRunHook` callbacks which are run inside
		    the evaluation loop.
		  config: An instance of `tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto` that will be used to
		    configure the `Session`. If left as `None`, the default will be used.
		
		Returns:
		  The fetched values of `final_ops` or `None` if `final_ops` is `None`.

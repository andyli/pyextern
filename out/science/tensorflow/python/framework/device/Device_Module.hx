	/**
		Returns a device function that merges devices specifications.
		
		This can be used to merge partial specifications of devices. The
		innermost setting for a device field takes precedence. For example:
		
		  with tf.device(merge_device("/device:GPU:0"))
		    # Nodes created here have device "/device:GPU:0"
		    with tf.device(merge_device("/job:worker")):
		      # Nodes created here have device "/job:worker/device:GPU:0"
		      with tf.device(merge_device("/device:CPU:0")):
		        # Nodes created here have device "/job:worker/device:CPU:0"
		        with tf.device(merge_device("/job:ps")):
		          # Nodes created here have device "/job:ps/device:CPU:0"
		
		Args:
		  spec: A `DeviceSpec` or a device spec string (partially) describing the
		    device that should be used for all nodes created in the scope of
		    the returned device function's with block.
		
		Returns:
		  A MergeDevice object with the above-described behavior.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: if the spec was not valid.

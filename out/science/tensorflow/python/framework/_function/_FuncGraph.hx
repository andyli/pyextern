	/**
		Returns a context manager that specifies control dependencies.
		
		Use with the `with` keyword to specify that all operations constructed
		within the context should have control dependencies on
		`control_inputs`. For example:
		
		```python
		with g.control_dependencies([a, b, c]):
		  # `d` and `e` will only run after `a`, `b`, and `c` have executed.
		  d = ...
		  e = ...
		```
		
		Multiple calls to `control_dependencies()` can be nested, and in
		that case a new `Operation` will have control dependencies on the union
		of `control_inputs` from all active contexts.
		
		```python
		with g.control_dependencies([a, b]):
		  # Ops constructed here run after `a` and `b`.
		  with g.control_dependencies([c, d]):
		    # Ops constructed here run after `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
		```
		
		You can pass None to clear the control dependencies:
		
		```python
		with g.control_dependencies([a, b]):
		  # Ops constructed here run after `a` and `b`.
		  with g.control_dependencies(None):
		    # Ops constructed here run normally, not waiting for either `a` or `b`.
		    with g.control_dependencies([c, d]):
		      # Ops constructed here run after `c` and `d`, also not waiting
		      # for either `a` or `b`.
		```
		
		*N.B.* The control dependencies context applies *only* to ops that
		are constructed within the context. Merely using an op or tensor
		in the context does not add a control dependency. The following
		example illustrates this point:
		
		```python
		# WRONG
		def my_func(pred, tensor):
		  t = tf.matmul(tensor, tensor)
		  with tf.control_dependencies([pred]):
		    # The matmul op is created outside the context, so no control
		    # dependency will be added.
		    return t
		
		# RIGHT
		def my_func(pred, tensor):
		  with tf.control_dependencies([pred]):
		    # The matmul op is created in the context, so a control dependency
		    # will be added.
		    return tf.matmul(tensor, tensor)
		```
		
		Also note that though execution of ops created under this scope will trigger
		execution of the dependencies, the ops created under this scope might still
		be pruned from a normal tensorflow graph. For example, in the following
		snippet of code the dependencies are never executed:
		
		```python
		  loss = model.loss()
		  with tf.control_dependencies(dependencies):
		    loss = loss + tf.constant(1)  # note: dependencies ignored in the
		                                  # backward pass
		  return tf.gradients(loss, model.variables)
		```
		
		This is because evaluating the gradient graph does not require evaluating
		the constant(1) op created in the forward pass.

		  control_inputs: A list of `Operation` or `Tensor` objects which must be
		    executed or computed before running the operations defined in the

		Returns a context manager that creates hierarchical names for operations.
		
		A graph maintains a stack of name scopes. A `with name_scope(...):`
		statement pushes a new name onto the stack for the lifetime of the context.
		
		The `name` argument will be interpreted as follows:
		
		* A string (not ending with '/') will create a new name scope, in which
		  `name` is appended to the prefix of all operations created in the
		  context. If `name` has been used before, it will be made unique by
		  calling `self.unique_name(name)`.
		* A scope previously captured from a `with g.name_scope(...) as

		  makes it possible to re-enter existing scopes.
		* A value of `None` or the empty string will reset the current name scope
		  to the top-level (empty) name scope.
		
		For example:
		
		```python
		with tf.Graph().as_default() as g:
		  c = tf.constant(5.0, name="c")
		  assert c.op.name == "c"
		  c_1 = tf.constant(6.0, name="c")

		    # Creates a nested scope called "inner".
		    with g.name_scope("inner"):
		      nested_inner_c = tf.constant(20.0, name="c")
		      assert nested_inner_c.op.name == "nested/inner/c"
		
		    # Create a nested scope called "inner_1".
		    with g.name_scope("inner"):
		      nested_inner_1_c = tf.constant(30.0, name="c")
		      assert nested_inner_1_c.op.name == "nested/inner_1/c"

		          e = tf.constant(50.0, name="e")
		          assert e.op.name == "e"
		```
		
		The name of the scope itself can be captured by `with
		g.name_scope(...) as scope:`, which stores the name of the scope
		in the variable `scope`. This value can be used to name an

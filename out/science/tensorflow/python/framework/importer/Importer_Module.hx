	/**
		Imports the graph from `graph_def` into the current default `Graph`.
		
		This function provides a way to import a serialized TensorFlow
		[`GraphDef`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/framework/graph.proto)
		protocol buffer, and extract individual objects in the `GraphDef` as
		`tf.Tensor` and `tf.Operation` objects. Once extracted,
		these objects are placed into the current default `Graph`. See
		`tf.Graph.as_graph_def` for a way to create a `GraphDef`
		proto.
		
		Args:
		  graph_def: A `GraphDef` proto containing operations to be imported into the
		    default graph.
		  input_map: A dictionary mapping input names (as strings) in `graph_def` to
		    `Tensor` objects. The values of the named input tensors in the imported
		    graph will be re-mapped to the respective `Tensor` values.
		  return_elements: A list of strings containing operation names in `graph_def`
		    that will be returned as `Operation` objects; and/or tensor names in
		    `graph_def` that will be returned as `Tensor` objects.
		  validate_colocation_constraints: Whether to validate colocation constraints.
		  name: (Optional.) A prefix that will be prepended to the names in
		    `graph_def`. Note that this does not apply to imported function names.
		    Defaults to `"import"`.
		  producer_op_list: (Optional.) An `OpList` proto with the (possibly stripped)
		    list of `OpDef`s used by the producer of the graph. If provided,
		    unrecognized attrs for ops in `graph_def` that have their default value
		    according to `producer_op_list` will be removed. This will allow some more
		    `GraphDef`s produced by later binaries to be accepted by earlier binaries.
		
		Returns:
		  A list of `Operation` and/or `Tensor` objects from the imported graph,
		  corresponding to the names in `return_elements`,
		  and None if `returns_elements` is None.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: If `graph_def` is not a `GraphDef` proto,
		    `input_map` is not a dictionary mapping strings to `Tensor` objects,
		    or `return_elements` is not a list of strings.
		  ValueError: If `input_map`, or `return_elements` contains names that
		    do not appear in `graph_def`, or `graph_def` is not well-formed (e.g.
		    it refers to an unknown tensor).

	/**
		Decorator for marking specific function arguments as deprecated.
		
		This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
		called with the deprecated argument. It has the following format:
		
		  Calling <function> (from <module>) with <arg> is deprecated and will be
		  removed after <date>. Instructions for updating:
		    <instructions>
		
		If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
		<function> includes the class name if it is a method.
		
		It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated arguments)' is
		appended to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is
		prepended to the rest of the docstring.
		
		Args:
		  date: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
		    Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
		  instructions: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
		    deprecated function.
		  *deprecated_arg_names_or_tuples: String or 2-Tuple (String,
		    ok_val).  The string is the deprecated argument name.
		    Optionally, an ok-value may be provided.  If the user provided
		    argument equals this value, the warning is suppressed.
		  **kwargs: If `warn_once=False` is passed, every call with a deprecated
		    argument will log a warning. The default behavior is to only warn the
		    first time the function is called with any given deprecated argument.
		    All other kwargs raise `ValueError`.
		
		Returns:
		  Decorated function or method.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, instructions are
		    empty, the deprecated arguments are not present in the function
		    signature, the second element of a deprecated_tuple is not a
		    list, or if a kwarg other than `warn_once` is passed.

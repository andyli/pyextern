	/**
		Subscribe to a tensor.
		
		This method will attach side effect graphs to a given set
		of tensors. Set of tensors follows from session.run and supports
		single `Tensor`, `list`, nested `list`, `tuple`, `namedtuple`, or `dict`. It
		returns the tensors in the same passed in structure, but as clones with
		side effects applied. The supplied side effect graphs are specified
		as a constructor function which takes the target tensor and
		constructs a side effect graph and returns a list of ops that should
		be control dependencies on fetching the tensor. It will append
		'subscription' to the name scope of the tensor for every node in
		the side effect graph. These control dependencies are what trigger
		the side effects. Subscribe will construct the additions to your
		graph and return the created identity tensor downstream of the control
		dependencies. Use these tensors as you would normally in the rest of
		your tensorflow code. If a given tensor has already been subscribed or a
		tensor returned by a call to subscribe is passed, the previously created
		identity tensor will be reused and the side effect graphs will be added to
		the existing ones.
		
		Args:
		  tensors: `Tensor` or set of tensors to subscribe to. Set of tensors format
		    follows from `Session.run` and supports single `Tensor`, `list`, nested
		    `list`, `tuple`, `namedtuple`, or `dict`.
		  side_effects: Function(s) that takes a `Tensor`, construct a subgraph, and
		    return a nonempty list of control dependencies. This can be a single
		    function or list of functions.
		
		Returns:
		  Subscribed tensors, which are identity copies of the passed in tensors
		    in the same passed in structure, but the graph has been modified
		    such that these are downstream of the control dependencies for
		    the side effect graphs. Use these functionally equivalent tensors
		    instead of the passed in tensors for further construction or running.

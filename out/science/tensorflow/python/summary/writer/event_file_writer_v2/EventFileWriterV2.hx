		Creates an `EventFileWriterV2` and an event file to write to.
		
		On construction, this calls `tf.contrib.summary.create_file_writer` within
		the graph from `session.graph` to look up a shared summary writer resource
		for `logdir` if one exists, and create one if not. Creating the summary
		writer resource in turn creates a new event file in `logdir` to be filled
		with `Event` protocol buffers passed to `add_event`. Graph ops to control
		this writer resource are added to `session.graph` during this init call;
		stateful methods on this class will call `session.run()` on these ops.
		
		Note that because the underlying resource is shared, it is possible that
		other parts of the code using the same session may interact independently
		with the resource, e.g. by flushing or even closing it. It is the caller's
		responsibility to avoid any undesirable sharing in this regard.
		
		The remaining arguments to the constructor (`flush_secs`, `max_queue`, and
		`filename_suffix`) control the construction of the shared writer resource
		if one is created. If an existing resource is reused, these arguments have
		no effect.  See `tf.contrib.summary.create_file_writer` for details.
		
		Args:
		  session: A `tf.compat.v1.Session`. Session that will hold shared writer
		    resource. The writer ops will be added to session.graph during this
		    init call.
		  logdir: A string. Directory where event file will be written.
		  max_queue: Integer. Size of the queue for pending events and summaries.
		  flush_secs: Number. How often, in seconds, to flush the
		    pending events and summaries to disk.
		  filename_suffix: A string. Every event file's name is suffixed with
		    `filename_suffix`.

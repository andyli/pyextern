		Decorator for marking functions or methods deprecated.
		
		This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
		called. It has the following format:
		
		  <function> (from <module>) is deprecated and will be removed after <date>.
		  Instructions for updating:
		  <instructions>
		
		If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
		<function> will include the class name if it is a method.
		
		It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated)' is appended
		to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is prepended
		to the rest of the docstring.
		
		Args:
		  date: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
		    Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
		  instructions: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
		    deprecated function.
		  warn_once: Boolean. Set to `True` to warn only the first time the decorated
		    function is called. Otherwise, every call will log a warning.
		
		Returns:
		  Decorated function or method.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, or instructions are
		    empty.

		Deprecate a symbol in favor of a new name with identical semantics.
		
		This function is meant to be used when defining a backwards-compatibility
		alias for a symbol which has been moved. For example:
		
		module1.py:
		```python
		class NewNameForClass: pass
		```
		
		module2.py:
		```python
		import module1
		
		DeprecatedNameForClass = deprecated_alias(
		  deprecated_name='module2.DeprecatedNameForClass',
		  name='module1.NewNameForClass',
		  func_or_class=module1.NewNameForClass)
		```
		
		This function works for classes and functions.
		
		For classes, it creates a new class which is functionally identical (it
		inherits from the original, and overrides its constructor), but which prints
		a deprecation warning when an instance is created. It also adds a deprecation
		notice to the class' docstring.
		
		For functions, it returns a function wrapped by `tf_decorator.make_decorator`.
		That function prints a warning when used, and has a deprecation notice in its
		docstring. This is more or less equivalent (the deprecation warning has
		slightly different text) to writing:
		
		```python
		@deprecated
		def deprecated_alias(original_args):
		  real_function(original_args)
		```
		
		Args:
		  deprecated_name: The name of the symbol that is being deprecated, to be used
		    in the warning message. This should be its fully qualified name to avoid
		    confusion.
		  name: The name of the symbol that is to be used instead of the deprecated
		    name. This should be a fully qualified name to avoid confusion.
		  func_or_class: The (non-deprecated) class or function for which a deprecated
		    alias should be created.
		  warn_once: If True (the default), only print a deprecation warning the first
		    time this function is used, or the class is instantiated.
		
		Returns:
		  A wrapped version of `func_or_class` which prints a deprecation warning on
		  use and has a modified docstring.

		  will be removed after <date>. Instructions for updating:

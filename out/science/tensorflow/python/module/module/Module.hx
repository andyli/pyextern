		connected using `_add_trackable_child`.
		
		**Example**
		
		`tf.Module`, `tf.keras.Model` and Keras layers use `__setattr__` to track
		children. This is why users can call `model.v = tf.Variable(...)`, and the
		variable will be automatically saved to the checkpoint. The implementation

		```
		def _add_trackable_child(self, name, value):

		This function is only used by the Python API. C++ and TensorFlow Serving do
		not have access to your registered class and cannot execute any of the
		non-tf.functions attached to the Python class. However, all signatures and
		tf.functions are still accessible.
		
		**Avoid creating duplicate trackables**
		
		SavedModel is saved by recursively gathering all of the trackables and their
		children. SavedModel loading reverses those steps by creating all
		trackables, then reconnecting the children trackables to their parents using
		`Trackable._add_trackable_child`.
		
		That means that if `_deserialize_from_proto` calls the `__init__` function,
		which creates all of the children trackables, then those children end up
		being created *twice*.
		
		To avoid this, structure your code so that Trackables are not created
		when deserialized from SavedModel:
		
		```
		@register_serializable()
		class Serializable(trackable):
		  def __init __(self, from_proto=False):
		    create_non_trackable_objects()
		    if not from_proto:
		      create_variables_and_other_trackables()
		
		  def _deserialize_from_proto(cls, **kwargs):
		    return cls(from_proto=True)
		
		  def _add_trackable_child(self, name, value):

		    * proto: A `google.protobuf.Any` proto read from the SavedModel.

		`tf.compat.v1.train.Saver`'s
		`var_list` constructor argument).
		
		`SaveableObjects` have a name set, which Trackable needs to generate

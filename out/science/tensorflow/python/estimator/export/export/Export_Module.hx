		Build `SignatureDef`s for all export outputs.

		  receiver_tensors_alternatives: a dict of string to additional

		    string to `Tensor`.  These named receiver tensor alternatives generate
		    additional serving signatures, which may be used to feed inputs at

		  ValueError: if export_outputs is not a dict

		Note that this function calls the input_fn in a local graph in order to
		extract features and labels. Placeholders are then created from those
		features and labels in the default graph.
		
		Args:
		  input_fn: An Estimator input_fn, which is a function that returns one of:
		    * A 'tf.data.Dataset' object: Outputs of `Dataset` object must be a tuple
		      (features, labels) with same constraints as below.
		    * A tuple (features, labels): Where `features` is a `Tensor` or a

		      or a dictionary of string label name to `Tensor`. Both `features` and
		      `labels` are consumed by `model_fn`. They should satisfy the expectation
		      of `model_fn` from inputs.
		  **input_fn_args: set of kwargs to be passed to the input_fn. Note that these
		    will not be checked or validated here, and any errors raised by the
		    input_fn will be thrown to the top.
		
		Returns:
		  A function taking no arguments that, when called, returns a

	/**
		Gets a list of Paths in a given directory.
		
		Args:
		  base_dir: directory.
		  parser: a function which gets the raw Path and can augment it with
		    information such as the export_version, or ignore the path by returning
		    None.  An example parser may extract the export version from a path such
		    as "/tmp/exports/100" an another may extract from a full file name such as
		    "/tmp/checkpoint-99.out".
		
		Returns:
		  A list of Paths contained in the base directory with the parsing function
		  applied.
		  By default the following fields are populated,
		    - Path.path
		  The parsing function is responsible for populating,
		    - Path.export_version

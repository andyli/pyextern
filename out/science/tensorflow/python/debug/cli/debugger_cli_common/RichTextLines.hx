		Constructor of RichTextLines.
		
		Args:
		  lines: A list of str or a single str, representing text output to
		    screen. The latter case is for convenience when the text output is
		    single-line.
		  font_attr_segs: A map from 0-based row index to a list of 3-tuples.
		    It lists segments in each row that have special font attributes, such
		    as colors, that are not the default attribute. For example:
		    {1: [(0, 3, "red"), (4, 7, "green")], 2: [(10, 20, "yellow")]}
		
		    In each tuple, the 1st element is the start index of the segment. The
		    2nd element is the end index, in an "open interval" fashion. The 3rd
		    element is an object or a list of objects that represents the font
		    attribute. Colors are represented as strings as in the examples above.
		  annotations: A map from 0-based row index to any object for annotating
		    the row. A typical use example is annotating rows of the output as
		    indices in a multi-dimensional tensor. For example, consider the
		    following text representation of a 3x2x2 tensor:
		      [[[0, 0], [0, 0]],
		       [[0, 0], [0, 0]],
		       [[0, 0], [0, 0]]]
		    The annotation can indicate the indices of the first element shown in
		    each row, i.e.,
		      {0: [0, 0, 0], 1: [1, 0, 0], 2: [2, 0, 0]}
		    This information can make display of tensors on screen clearer and can
		    help the user navigate (scroll) to the desired location in a large
		    tensor.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If lines is of invalid type.

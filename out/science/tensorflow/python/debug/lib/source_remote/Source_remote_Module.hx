		Send the tracebacks of a TensorFlow execution call.
		
		To gRPC debug server(s). This applies to graph execution (`tf.Session.run()`)
		calls and eager execution calls.
		
		If `send_source`, also sends the underlying source files outside the
		TensorFlow library.
		
		Args:
		  destinations: gRPC destination addresses, a `str` or a `list` of `str`s,
		    e.g., "localhost:4242". If a `list`, gRPC requests containing the same
		    `CallTraceback` proto payload will be sent to all the destinations.
		  origin_stack: The traceback stack for the origin of the execution call. For
		    graph execution, this is the traceback of the `tf.Session.run()`
		    invocation. For eager execution, this is the traceback of the Python
		    line that executes the eager operation.
		  is_eager_execution: (`bool`) whether an eager execution call (i.e., not a
		    `tf.Session.run` or derived methods) is being sent.
		  call_key: The key of the execution call, as a string. For graph execution,
		    this is a string describing the feeds, fetches (and targets) names of the
		    `tf.Session.run` call. For eager execution, this is ignored.
		  graph: A Python `tf.Graph` object (i.e., *not* a `tf.compat.v1.GraphDef`),
		    which contains op tracebacks, if applicable.
		  send_source: Whether the source files involved in the op tracebacks but
		    outside the TensorFlow library are to be sent.

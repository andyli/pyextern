		A special construct usable to annotate class objects.
		
		For example, suppose we have the following classes::
		
		  class User: ...  # Abstract base for User classes
		  class BasicUser(User): ...
		  class ProUser(User): ...
		  class TeamUser(User): ...
		
		And a function that takes a class argument that's a subclass of
		User and returns an instance of the corresponding class::
		
		  U = TypeVar('U', bound=User)
		  def new_user(user_class: Type[U]) -> U:
		      user = user_class()
		      # (Here we could write the user object to a database)
		      return user
		
		  joe = new_user(BasicUser)
		
		At this point the type checker knows that joe has type BasicUser.

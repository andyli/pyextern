		Estimate a covariance matrix, given data and weights.
		
		Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
		If we examine N-dimensional samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]^T`,
		then the covariance matrix element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of
		:math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`. The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance
		of :math:`x_i`.
		
		See the notes for an outline of the algorithm.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		m : array_like
		    A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
		    Each row of `m` represents a variable, and each column a single
		    observation of all those variables. Also see `rowvar` below.
		y : array_like, optional
		    An additional set of variables and observations. `y` has the same form
		    as that of `m`.
		rowvar : bool, optional
		    If `rowvar` is True (default), then each row represents a
		    variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise, the relationship
		    is transposed: each column represents a variable, while the rows
		    contain observations.
		bias : bool, optional
		    Default normalization (False) is by ``(N - 1)``, where ``N`` is the
		    number of observations given (unbiased estimate). If `bias` is True,
		    then normalization is by ``N``. These values can be overridden by using
		    the keyword ``ddof`` in numpy versions >= 1.5.
		ddof : int, optional
		    If not ``None`` the default value implied by `bias` is overridden.
		    Note that ``ddof=1`` will return the unbiased estimate, even if both
		    `fweights` and `aweights` are specified, and ``ddof=0`` will return
		    the simple average. See the notes for the details. The default value
		    is ``None``.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.5
		fweights : array_like, int, optional
		    1-D array of integer frequency weights; the number of times each
		    observation vector should be repeated.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.10
		aweights : array_like, optional
		    1-D array of observation vector weights. These relative weights are
		    typically large for observations considered "important" and smaller for
		    observations considered less "important". If ``ddof=0`` the array of
		    weights can be used to assign probabilities to observation vectors.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.10
		dtype : data-type, optional
		    Data-type of the result. By default, the return data-type will have
		    at least `numpy.float64` precision.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.20
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray
		    The covariance matrix of the variables.
		
		See Also
		--------
		corrcoef : Normalized covariance matrix
		
		Notes
		-----
		Assume that the observations are in the columns of the observation
		array `m` and let ``f = fweights`` and ``a = aweights`` for brevity. The
		steps to compute the weighted covariance are as follows::
		
		    >>> m = np.arange(10, dtype=np.float64)
		    >>> f = np.arange(10) * 2
		    >>> a = np.arange(10) ** 2.
		    >>> ddof = 1
		    >>> w = f * a
		    >>> v1 = np.sum(w)
		    >>> v2 = np.sum(w * a)
		    >>> m -= np.sum(m * w, axis=None, keepdims=True) / v1
		    >>> cov = np.dot(m * w, m.T) * v1 / (v1**2 - ddof * v2)
		
		Note that when ``a == 1``, the normalization factor
		``v1 / (v1**2 - ddof * v2)`` goes over to ``1 / (np.sum(f) - ddof)``
		as it should.
		
		Examples
		--------
		Consider two variables, :math:`x_0` and :math:`x_1`, which
		correlate perfectly, but in opposite directions:
		
		>>> x = np.array([[0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0]]).T
		>>> x
		array([[0, 1, 2],
		       [2, 1, 0]])
		
		Note how :math:`x_0` increases while :math:`x_1` decreases. The covariance
		matrix shows this clearly:
		
		>>> np.cov(x)
		array([[ 1., -1.],
		       [-1.,  1.]])
		
		Note that element :math:`C_{0,1}`, which shows the correlation between
		:math:`x_0` and :math:`x_1`, is negative.
		
		Further, note how `x` and `y` are combined:
		
		>>> x = [-2.1, -1,  4.3]
		>>> y = [3,  1.1,  0.12]
		>>> X = np.stack((x, y), axis=0)
		>>> np.cov(X)
		array([[11.71      , -4.286     ], # may vary
		       [-4.286     ,  2.144133]])
		>>> np.cov(x, y)
		array([[11.71      , -4.286     ], # may vary
		       [-4.286     ,  2.144133]])

		exp(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj])
		
		Calculate the exponential of all elements in the input array.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Input values.
		out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
		    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
		    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
		    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
		    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
		where : array_like, optional
		    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
		    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
		    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
		    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
		    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
		    remain uninitialized.
		**kwargs
		    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
		    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar
		    Output array, element-wise exponential of `x`.
		    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.
		
		See Also
		--------
		expm1 : Calculate ``exp(x) - 1`` for all elements in the array.
		exp2  : Calculate ``2**x`` for all elements in the array.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The irrational number ``e`` is also known as Euler's number.  It is
		approximately 2.718281, and is the base of the natural logarithm,
		``ln`` (this means that, if :math:`x = \ln y = \log_e y`,
		then :math:`e^x = y`. For real input, ``exp(x)`` is always positive.
		
		For complex arguments, ``x = a + ib``, we can write
		:math:`e^x = e^a e^{ib}`.  The first term, :math:`e^a`, is already
		known (it is the real argument, described above).  The second term,
		:math:`e^{ib}`, is :math:`\cos b + i \sin b`, a function with
		magnitude 1 and a periodic phase.

		Return a contiguous flattened array.
		
		A 1-D array, containing the elements of the input, is returned.  A copy is
		made only if needed.
		
		As of NumPy 1.10, the returned array will have the same type as the input
		array. (for example, a masked array will be returned for a masked array
		input)
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array.  The elements in `a` are read in the order specified by
		    `order`, and packed as a 1-D array.
		order : {'C','F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
		
		    The elements of `a` are read using this index order. 'C' means
		    to index the elements in row-major, C-style order,
		    with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
		    axis index changing slowest.  'F' means to index the elements
		    in column-major, Fortran-style order, with the
		    first index changing fastest, and the last index changing
		    slowest. Note that the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of
		    the memory layout of the underlying array, and only refer to
		    the order of axis indexing.  'A' means to read the elements in
		    Fortran-like index order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in
		    memory, C-like order otherwise.  'K' means to read the
		    elements in the order they occur in memory, except for
		    reversing the data when strides are negative.  By default, 'C'
		    index order is used.
		
		Returns
		-------
		y : array_like
		    y is an array of the same subtype as `a`, with shape ``(a.size,)``.
		    Note that matrices are special cased for backward compatibility, if `a`
		    is a matrix, then y is a 1-D ndarray.
		
		See Also
		--------
		ndarray.flat : 1-D iterator over an array.
		ndarray.flatten : 1-D array copy of the elements of an array
		                  in row-major order.
		ndarray.reshape : Change the shape of an array without changing its data.
		
		Notes
		-----
		In row-major, C-style order, in two dimensions, the row index
		varies the slowest, and the column index the quickest.  This can
		be generalized to multiple dimensions, where row-major order
		implies that the index along the first axis varies slowest, and
		the index along the last quickest.  The opposite holds for
		column-major, Fortran-style index ordering.
		
		When a view is desired in as many cases as possible, ``arr.reshape(-1)``
		may be preferable.
		
		Examples
		--------
		It is equivalent to ``reshape(-1, order=order)``.
		
		>>> x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
		>>> np.ravel(x)
		array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
		
		>>> x.reshape(-1)
		array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
		
		>>> np.ravel(x, order='F')
		array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6])
		
		When ``order`` is 'A', it will preserve the array's 'C' or 'F' ordering:
		
		>>> np.ravel(x.T)
		array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6])
		>>> np.ravel(x.T, order='A')
		array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
		
		When ``order`` is 'K', it will preserve orderings that are neither 'C'
		nor 'F', but won't reverse axes:
		
		>>> a = np.arange(3)[::-1]; a
		array([2, 1, 0])
		>>> a.ravel(order='C')

		    elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
		    means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
		    with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
		    axis index changing slowest. 'F' means to read / write the
		    elements using Fortran-like index order, with the first index
		    changing fastest, and the last index changing slowest. Note that
		    the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of the memory layout of
		    the underlying array, and only refer to the order of indexing.
		    'A' means to read / write the elements in Fortran-like index
		    order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory, C-like order
		    otherwise.
		
		Returns
		-------
		reshaped_array : ndarray
		    This will be a new view object if possible; otherwise, it will
		    be a copy.  Note there is no guarantee of the *memory layout* (C- or
		    Fortran- contiguous) of the returned array.
		
		See Also
		--------
		ndarray.reshape : Equivalent method.
		
		Notes
		-----
		It is not always possible to change the shape of an array without
		copying the data. If you want an error to be raised when the data is copied,
		you should assign the new shape to the shape attribute of the array::
		
		 >>> a = np.zeros((10, 2))
		
		 # A transpose makes the array non-contiguous
		 >>> b = a.T
		
		 # Taking a view makes it possible to modify the shape without modifying
		 # the initial object.
		 >>> c = b.view()
		 >>> c.shape = (20)
		 Traceback (most recent call last):
		    ...
		 AttributeError: Incompatible shape for in-place modification. Use
		 `.reshape()` to make a copy with the desired shape.
		
		The `order` keyword gives the index ordering both for *fetching* the values
		from `a`, and then *placing* the values into the output array.
		For example, let's say you have an array:
		
		>>> a = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
		>>> a
		array([[0, 1],
		       [2, 3],
		       [4, 5]])
		
		You can think of reshaping as first raveling the array (using the given
		index order), then inserting the elements from the raveled array into the
		new array using the same kind of index ordering as was used for the
		raveling.
		
		>>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3)) # C-like index ordering
		array([[0, 1, 2],
		       [3, 4, 5]])
		>>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a), (2, 3)) # equivalent to C ravel then C reshape
		array([[0, 1, 2],
		       [3, 4, 5]])
		>>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3), order='F') # Fortran-like index ordering
		array([[0, 4, 3],
		       [2, 1, 5]])
		>>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a, order='F'), (2, 3), order='F')
		array([[0, 4, 3],
		       [2, 1, 5]])
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
		>>> np.reshape(a, 6)
		array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
		>>> np.reshape(a, 6, order='F')
		array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6])
		
		>>> np.reshape(a, (3,-1))       # the unspecified value is inferred to be 2

	/**
		Sum of array elements over a given axis.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Elements to sum.
		axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Axis or axes along which a sum is performed.  The default,
		    axis=None, will sum all of the elements of the input array.  If
		    axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
		
		    If axis is a tuple of ints, a sum is performed on all of the axes
		    specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as
		    before.
		dtype : dtype, optional
		    The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
		    elements are summed.  The dtype of `a` is used by default unless `a`
		    has an integer dtype of less precision than the default platform
		    integer.  In that case, if `a` is signed then the platform integer
		    is used while if `a` is unsigned then an unsigned integer of the
		    same precision as the platform integer is used.
		out : ndarray, optional
		    Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
		    the same shape as the expected output, but the type of the output
		    values will be cast if necessary.
		keepdims : bool, optional
		    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
		    in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
		    the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.
		
		    If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
		    passed through to the `sum` method of sub-classes of
		    `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
		    sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
		    exceptions will be raised.
		initial : scalar, optional
		    Starting value for the sum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.15.0
		
		where : array_like of bool, optional
		    Elements to include in the sum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.17.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		sum_along_axis : ndarray
		    An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified
		    axis removed.   If `a` is a 0-d array, or if `axis` is None, a scalar
		    is returned.  If an output array is specified, a reference to
		    `out` is returned.

		trapz : Integration of array values using the composite trapezoidal rule.
		
		mean, average
		
		Notes
		-----
		Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
		raised on overflow.
		
		The sum of an empty array is the neutral element 0:
		
		>>> np.sum([])
		0.0
		
		For floating point numbers the numerical precision of sum (and
		``np.add.reduce``) is in general limited by directly adding each number
		individually to the result causing rounding errors in every step.
		However, often numpy will use a  numerically better approach (partial
		pairwise summation) leading to improved precision in many use-cases.
		This improved precision is always provided when no ``axis`` is given.
		When ``axis`` is given, it will depend on which axis is summed.
		Technically, to provide the best speed possible, the improved precision
		is only used when the summation is along the fast axis in memory.
		Note that the exact precision may vary depending on other parameters.
		In contrast to NumPy, Python's ``math.fsum`` function uses a slower but
		more precise approach to summation.
		Especially when summing a large number of lower precision floating point
		numbers, such as ``float32``, numerical errors can become significant.
		In such cases it can be advisable to use `dtype="float64"` to use a higher
		precision for the output.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> np.sum([0.5, 1.5])
		2.0
		>>> np.sum([0.5, 0.7, 0.2, 1.5], dtype=np.int32)
		1
		>>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]])
		6
		>>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]], axis=0)
		array([0, 6])
		>>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]], axis=1)
		array([1, 5])
		>>> np.sum([[0, 1], [np.nan, 5]], where=[False, True], axis=1)
		array([1., 5.])
		
		If the accumulator is too small, overflow occurs:
		
		>>> np.ones(128, dtype=np.int8).sum(dtype=np.int8)
		-128
		
		You can also start the sum with a value other than zero:
		
		>>> np.sum([10], initial=5)

	/**
		Reverse or permute the axes of an array; returns the modified array.
		
		For an array a with two axes, transpose(a) gives the matrix transpose.
		
		Refer to `numpy.ndarray.transpose` for full documentation.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array.
		axes : tuple or list of ints, optional
		    If specified, it must be a tuple or list which contains a permutation of
		    [0,1,..,N-1] where N is the number of axes of a.  The i'th axis of the
		    returned array will correspond to the axis numbered ``axes[i]`` of the
		    input.  If not specified, defaults to ``range(a.ndim)[::-1]``, which
		    reverses the order of the axes.
		
		Returns
		-------
		p : ndarray
		    `a` with its axes permuted.  A view is returned whenever
		    possible.
		
		See Also
		--------
		ndarray.transpose : Equivalent method
		moveaxis
		argsort
		
		Notes
		-----
		Use `transpose(a, argsort(axes))` to invert the transposition of tensors
		when using the `axes` keyword argument.
		
		Transposing a 1-D array returns an unchanged view of the original array.

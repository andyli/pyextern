		Most references to the Bartlett window come from the signal
		processing literature, where it is used as one of many windowing
		functions for smoothing values.  Note that convolution with this
		window produces linear interpolation.  It is also known as an
		apodization (which means"removing the foot", i.e. smoothing
		discontinuities at the beginning and end of the sampled signal) or
		tapering function. The Fourier transform of the Bartlett is the product
		of two sinc functions.
		Note the excellent discussion in Kanasewich. [2]_

	/**
		Bessel/Thomson digital and analog filter design.
		
		Design an Nth-order digital or analog Bessel filter and return the
		filter coefficients.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		N : int
		    The order of the filter.
		Wn : array_like
		    A scalar or length-2 sequence giving the critical frequencies (defined
		    by the `norm` parameter).
		    For analog filters, `Wn` is an angular frequency (e.g., rad/s).
		
		    For digital filters, `Wn` are in the same units as `fs`.  By default,
		    `fs` is 2 half-cycles/sample, so these are normalized from 0 to 1,
		    where 1 is the Nyquist frequency. (`Wn` is thus in
		    half-cycles / sample.)
		btype : {'lowpass', 'highpass', 'bandpass', 'bandstop'}, optional
		    The type of filter.  Default is 'lowpass'.
		analog : bool, optional
		    When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is
		    returned. (See Notes.)
		output : {'ba', 'zpk', 'sos'}, optional
		    Type of output:  numerator/denominator ('ba'), pole-zero ('zpk'), or
		    second-order sections ('sos'). Default is 'ba'.
		norm : {'phase', 'delay', 'mag'}, optional
		    Critical frequency normalization:
		
		    ``phase``
		        The filter is normalized such that the phase response reaches its
		        midpoint at angular (e.g. rad/s) frequency `Wn`. This happens for
		        both low-pass and high-pass filters, so this is the
		        "phase-matched" case.
		
		        The magnitude response asymptotes are the same as a Butterworth
		        filter of the same order with a cutoff of `Wn`.
		
		        This is the default, and matches MATLAB's implementation.
		
		    ``delay``
		        The filter is normalized such that the group delay in the passband
		        is 1/`Wn` (e.g., seconds). This is the "natural" type obtained by
		        solving Bessel polynomials.
		
		    ``mag``
		        The filter is normalized such that the gain magnitude is -3 dB at
		        angular frequency `Wn`.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 0.18.0
		fs : float, optional
		    The sampling frequency of the digital system.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.2.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		b, a : ndarray, ndarray
		    Numerator (`b`) and denominator (`a`) polynomials of the IIR filter.
		    Only returned if ``output='ba'``.
		z, p, k : ndarray, ndarray, float
		    Zeros, poles, and system gain of the IIR filter transfer
		    function.  Only returned if ``output='zpk'``.
		sos : ndarray
		    Second-order sections representation of the IIR filter.
		    Only returned if ``output=='sos'``.
		
		Notes
		-----
		Also known as a Thomson filter, the analog Bessel filter has maximally
		flat group delay and maximally linear phase response, with very little
		ringing in the step response. [1]_
		
		The Bessel is inherently an analog filter. This function generates digital
		Bessel filters using the bilinear transform, which does not preserve the
		phase response of the analog filter. As such, it is only approximately
		correct at frequencies below about fs/4. To get maximally-flat group
		delay at higher frequencies, the analog Bessel filter must be transformed
		using phase-preserving techniques.
		
		See `besselap` for implementation details and references.
		
		The ``'sos'`` output parameter was added in 0.16.0.

		Return a Blackman window.
		
		The Blackman window is a taper formed by using the first three terms of
		a summation of cosines. It was designed to have close to the minimal
		leakage possible.  It is close to optimal, only slightly worse than a
		Kaiser window.
		
		.. warning:: scipy.signal.blackman is deprecated,
		             use scipy.signal.windows.blackman instead.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		M : int
		    Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an empty
		    array is returned.
		sym : bool, optional
		    When True (default), generates a symmetric window, for use in filter
		    design.
		    When False, generates a periodic window, for use in spectral analysis.
		
		Returns
		-------
		w : ndarray
		    The window, with the maximum value normalized to 1 (though the value 1
		    does not appear if `M` is even and `sym` is True).
		
		Notes
		-----
		The Blackman window is defined as
		
		.. math::  w(n) = 0.42 - 0.5 \cos(2\pi n/M) + 0.08 \cos(4\pi n/M)
		
		The "exact Blackman" window was designed to null out the third and fourth
		sidelobes, but has discontinuities at the boundaries, resulting in a
		6 dB/oct fall-off.  This window is an approximation of the "exact" window,
		which does not null the sidelobes as well, but is smooth at the edges,
		improving the fall-off rate to 18 dB/oct. [3]_
		
		Most references to the Blackman window come from the signal processing
		literature, where it is used as one of many windowing functions for
		smoothing values.  It is also known as an apodization (which means
		"removing the foot", i.e. smoothing discontinuities at the beginning
		and end of the sampled signal) or tapering function. It is known as a
		"near optimal" tapering function, almost as good (by some measures)
		as the Kaiser window.

	/**
		Butterworth digital and analog filter design.
		
		Design an Nth-order digital or analog Butterworth filter and return
		the filter coefficients.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		N : int
		    The order of the filter.
		Wn : array_like
		    The critical frequency or frequencies. For lowpass and highpass
		    filters, Wn is a scalar; for bandpass and bandstop filters,
		    Wn is a length-2 sequence.
		
		    For a Butterworth filter, this is the point at which the gain
		    drops to 1/sqrt(2) that of the passband (the "-3 dB point").
		
		    For digital filters, if `fs` is not specified, `Wn` units are
		    normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 is the Nyquist frequency (`Wn` is
		    thus in half cycles / sample and defined as 2*critical frequencies
		    / `fs`). If `fs` is specified, `Wn` is in the same units as `fs`.
		
		    For analog filters, `Wn` is an angular frequency (e.g. rad/s).
		btype : {'lowpass', 'highpass', 'bandpass', 'bandstop'}, optional
		    The type of filter.  Default is 'lowpass'.
		analog : bool, optional
		    When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is
		    returned.
		output : {'ba', 'zpk', 'sos'}, optional
		    Type of output:  numerator/denominator ('ba'), pole-zero ('zpk'), or
		    second-order sections ('sos'). Default is 'ba' for backwards
		    compatibility, but 'sos' should be used for general-purpose filtering.
		fs : float, optional
		    The sampling frequency of the digital system.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.2.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		b, a : ndarray, ndarray
		    Numerator (`b`) and denominator (`a`) polynomials of the IIR filter.
		    Only returned if ``output='ba'``.
		z, p, k : ndarray, ndarray, float
		    Zeros, poles, and system gain of the IIR filter transfer
		    function.  Only returned if ``output='zpk'``.
		sos : ndarray
		    Second-order sections representation of the IIR filter.
		    Only returned if ``output=='sos'``.
		
		See Also
		--------
		buttord, buttap
		
		Notes
		-----
		The Butterworth filter has maximally flat frequency response in the
		passband.
		
		The ``'sos'`` output parameter was added in 0.16.0.
		
		If the transfer function form ``[b, a]`` is requested, numerical
		problems can occur since the conversion between roots and
		the polynomial coefficients is a numerically sensitive operation,
		even for N >= 4. It is recommended to work with the SOS
		representation.
		
		Examples
		--------
		Design an analog filter and plot its frequency response, showing the
		critical points:
		
		>>> from scipy import signal
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		
		>>> b, a = signal.butter(4, 100, 'low', analog=True)
		>>> w, h = signal.freqs(b, a)
		>>> plt.semilogx(w, 20 * np.log10(abs(h)))
		>>> plt.title('Butterworth filter frequency response')
		>>> plt.xlabel('Frequency [radians / second]')
		>>> plt.ylabel('Amplitude [dB]')
		>>> plt.margins(0, 0.1)
		>>> plt.grid(which='both', axis='both')
		>>> plt.axvline(100, color='green') # cutoff frequency
		>>> plt.show()
		
		Generate a signal made up of 10 Hz and 20 Hz, sampled at 1 kHz
		
		>>> t = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000, False)  # 1 second
		>>> sig = np.sin(2*np.pi*10*t) + np.sin(2*np.pi*20*t)
		>>> fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)
		>>> ax1.plot(t, sig)
		>>> ax1.set_title('10 Hz and 20 Hz sinusoids')
		>>> ax1.axis([0, 1, -2, 2])
		
		Design a digital high-pass filter at 15 Hz to remove the 10 Hz tone, and
		apply it to the signal. (It's recommended to use second-order sections
		format when filtering, to avoid numerical error with transfer function
		(``ba``) format):

		Parameters
		----------
		wp, ws : float
		    Passband and stopband edge frequencies.
		
		    For digital filters, these are in the same units as `fs`. By default,

		        - Bandstop:  wp = [0.1, 0.6],   ws = [0.2, 0.5]

		-------
		ord : int

		    The Butterworth natural frequency (i.e. the "3dB frequency"). Should

		least `gstop` dB attenuation in the stopband.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		wp, ws : float
		    Passband and stopband edge frequencies.
		
		    For digital filters, these are in the same units as `fs`. By default,
		    `fs` is 2 half-cycles/sample, so these are normalized from 0 to 1,
		    where 1 is the Nyquist frequency. (`wp` and `ws` are thus in
		    half-cycles / sample.)  For example:
		
		        - Lowpass:   wp = 0.2,          ws = 0.3
		        - Highpass:  wp = 0.3,          ws = 0.2
		        - Bandpass:  wp = [0.2, 0.5],   ws = [0.1, 0.6]
		        - Bandstop:  wp = [0.1, 0.6],   ws = [0.2, 0.5]
		
		    For analog filters, `wp` and `ws` are angular frequencies (e.g., rad/s).
		gpass : float
		    The maximum loss in the passband (dB).
		gstop : float
		    The minimum attenuation in the stopband (dB).
		analog : bool, optional
		    When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is
		    returned.
		fs : float, optional
		    The sampling frequency of the digital system.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.2.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		ord : int
		    The lowest order for a Chebyshev type I filter that meets specs.
		wn : ndarray or float
		    The Chebyshev natural frequency (the "3dB frequency") for use with
		    `cheby1` to give filter results. If `fs` is specified,
		    this is in the same units, and `fs` must also be passed to `cheby1`.

		.. warning:: scipy.signal.chebwin is deprecated,

		Parameters
		----------
		M : int
		    Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an empty
		    array is returned.
		at : float
		    Attenuation (in dB).
		sym : bool, optional

		    When False, generates a periodic window, for use in spectral analysis.
		
		Returns
		-------
		w : ndarray
		    The window, with the maximum value always normalized to 1
		
		Notes
		-----
		This window optimizes for the narrowest main lobe width for a given order
		`M` and sidelobe equiripple attenuation `at`, using Chebyshev
		polynomials.  It was originally developed by Dolph to optimize the
		directionality of radio antenna arrays.
		
		Unlike most windows, the Dolph-Chebyshev is defined in terms of its
		frequency response:
		
		.. math:: W(k) = \frac
		          {\cos\{M \cos^{-1}[\beta \cos(\frac{\pi k}{M})]\}}
		          {\cosh[M \cosh^{-1}(\beta)]}
		
		where
		
		.. math:: \beta = \cosh \left [\frac{1}{M}
		          \cosh^{-1}(10^\frac{A}{20}) \right ]
		
		and 0 <= abs(k) <= M-1. A is the attenuation in decibels (`at`).
		
		The time domain window is then generated using the IFFT, so
		power-of-two `M` are the fastest to generate, and prime number `M` are
		the slowest.
		
		The equiripple condition in the frequency domain creates impulses in the
		time domain, which appear at the ends of the window.

		Chebyshev type I digital and analog filter design.
		
		Design an Nth-order digital or analog Chebyshev type I filter and

		Parameters
		----------
		N : int

		rp : float
		    The maximum ripple allowed below unity gain in the passband.

		Returns
		-------
		b, a : ndarray, ndarray

		Notes
		-----
		The Chebyshev type I filter maximizes the rate of cutoff between the
		frequency response's passband and stopband, at the expense of ripple in
		the passband and increased ringing in the step response.
		
		Type I filters roll off faster than Type II (`cheby2`), but Type II
		filters do not have any ripple in the passband.
		
		The equiripple passband has N maxima or minima (for example, a
		5th-order filter has 3 maxima and 2 minima). Consequently, the DC gain is
		unity for odd-order filters, or -rp dB for even-order filters.
		
		The ``'sos'`` output parameter was added in 0.16.0.

		Notes
		-----
		In order to enable inversion of an STFT via the inverse STFT in
		`istft`, it is sufficient that the signal windowing obeys the constraint of
		"Constant OverLap Add" (COLA). This ensures that every point in the input
		data is equally weighted, thereby avoiding aliasing and allowing full
		reconstruction.
		
		Some examples of windows that satisfy COLA:
		    - Rectangular window at overlap of 0, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...
		    - Bartlett window at overlap of 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, ...
		    - Hann window at 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...
		    - Any Blackman family window at 2/3 overlap
		    - Any window with ``noverlap = nperseg-1``
		
		A very comprehensive list of other windows may be found in [2]_,
		wherein the COLA condition is satisfied when the "Amplitude
		Flatness" is unity.

		In order to enable inversion of an STFT via the inverse STFT in
		`istft`, the signal windowing must obey the constraint of "nonzero
		overlap add" (NOLA):
		
		.. math:: \sum_{t}w^{2}[n-tH] \ne 0
		
		for all :math:`n`, where :math:`w` is the window function, :math:`t` is the
		frame index, and :math:`H` is the hop size (:math:`H` = `nperseg` -
		`noverlap`).
		
		This ensures that the normalization factors in the denominator of the
		overlap-add inversion equation are not zero. Only very pathological windows
		will fail the NOLA constraint.

		Frequency-swept cosine generator.
		
		In the following, 'Hz' should be interpreted as 'cycles per unit';
		there is no requirement here that the unit is one second.  The
		important distinction is that the units of rotation are cycles, not
		radians. Likewise, `t` could be a measurement of space instead of time.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		t : array_like
		    Times at which to evaluate the waveform.
		f0 : float
		    Frequency (e.g. Hz) at time t=0.
		t1 : float
		    Time at which `f1` is specified.
		f1 : float
		    Frequency (e.g. Hz) of the waveform at time `t1`.
		method : {'linear', 'quadratic', 'logarithmic', 'hyperbolic'}, optional
		    Kind of frequency sweep.  If not given, `linear` is assumed.  See
		    Notes below for more details.
		phi : float, optional
		    Phase offset, in degrees. Default is 0.
		vertex_zero : bool, optional
		    This parameter is only used when `method` is 'quadratic'.
		    It determines whether the vertex of the parabola that is the graph
		    of the frequency is at t=0 or t=t1.
		
		Returns
		-------
		y : ndarray
		    A numpy array containing the signal evaluated at `t` with the
		    requested time-varying frequency.  More precisely, the function
		    returns ``cos(phase + (pi/180)*phi)`` where `phase` is the integral
		    (from 0 to `t`) of ``2*pi*f(t)``. ``f(t)`` is defined below.
		
		See Also
		--------
		sweep_poly
		
		Notes
		-----
		There are four options for the `method`.  The following formulas give
		the instantaneous frequency (in Hz) of the signal generated by
		`chirp()`.  For convenience, the shorter names shown below may also be
		used.
		
		linear, lin, li:
		
		    ``f(t) = f0 + (f1 - f0) * t / t1``
		
		quadratic, quad, q:
		
		    The graph of the frequency f(t) is a parabola through (0, f0) and
		    (t1, f1).  By default, the vertex of the parabola is at (0, f0).
		    If `vertex_zero` is False, then the vertex is at (t1, f1).  The
		    formula is:
		
		    if vertex_zero is True:
		
		        ``f(t) = f0 + (f1 - f0) * t**2 / t1**2``
		
		    else:
		
		        ``f(t) = f1 - (f1 - f0) * (t1 - t)**2 / t1**2``
		
		    To use a more general quadratic function, or an arbitrary
		    polynomial, use the function `scipy.signal.sweep_poly`.
		
		logarithmic, log, lo:
		
		    ``f(t) = f0 * (f1/f0)**(t/t1)``
		
		    f0 and f1 must be nonzero and have the same sign.
		
		    This signal is also known as a geometric or exponential chirp.
		
		hyperbolic, hyp:
		
		    ``f(t) = f0*f1*t1 / ((f0 - f1)*t + f1*t1)``
		
		    f0 and f1 must be nonzero.
		
		Examples
		--------
		The following will be used in the examples:
		
		>>> from scipy.signal import chirp, spectrogram
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		
		For the first example, we'll plot the waveform for a linear chirp
		from 6 Hz to 1 Hz over 10 seconds:
		
		>>> t = np.linspace(0, 10, 1500)
		>>> w = chirp(t, f0=6, f1=1, t1=10, method='linear')
		>>> plt.plot(t, w)
		>>> plt.title("Linear Chirp, f(0)=6, f(10)=1")
		>>> plt.xlabel('t (sec)')
		>>> plt.show()
		
		For the remaining examples, we'll use higher frequency ranges,
		and demonstrate the result using `scipy.signal.spectrogram`.
		We'll use a 4 second interval sampled at 7200 Hz.
		
		>>> fs = 7200
		>>> T = 4
		>>> t = np.arange(0, int(T*fs)) / fs
		
		We'll use this function to plot the spectrogram in each example.
		
		>>> def plot_spectrogram(title, w, fs):
		...     ff, tt, Sxx = spectrogram(w, fs=fs, nperseg=256, nfft=576)
		...     plt.pcolormesh(tt, ff[:145], Sxx[:145], cmap='gray_r', shading='gouraud')
		...     plt.title(title)
		...     plt.xlabel('t (sec)')
		...     plt.ylabel('Frequency (Hz)')
		...     plt.grid()

		Find the fastest convolution/correlation method.
		
		This primarily exists to be called during the ``method='auto'`` option in
		`convolve` and `correlate`. It can also be used to determine the value of
		``method`` for many different convolutions of the same dtype/shape.
		In addition, it supports timing the convolution to adapt the value of
		``method`` to a particular set of inputs and/or hardware.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		in1 : array_like
		    The first argument passed into the convolution function.
		in2 : array_like
		    The second argument passed into the convolution function.
		mode : str {'full', 'valid', 'same'}, optional
		    A string indicating the size of the output:
		
		    ``full``
		       The output is the full discrete linear convolution
		       of the inputs. (Default)
		    ``valid``
		       The output consists only of those elements that do not
		       rely on the zero-padding.
		    ``same``
		       The output is the same size as `in1`, centered
		       with respect to the 'full' output.
		measure : bool, optional
		    If True, run and time the convolution of `in1` and `in2` with both
		    methods and return the fastest. If False (default), predict the fastest
		    method using precomputed values.
		
		Returns
		-------
		method : str
		    A string indicating which convolution method is fastest, either
		    'direct' or 'fft'
		times : dict, optional
		    A dictionary containing the times (in seconds) needed for each method.
		    This value is only returned if ``measure=True``.
		
		See Also
		--------
		convolve
		correlate
		
		Notes
		-----
		Generally, this method is 99% accurate for 2D signals and 85% accurate
		for 1D signals for randomly chosen input sizes. For precision, use
		``measure=True`` to find the fastest method by timing the convolution.
		This can be used to avoid the minimal overhead of finding the fastest
		``method`` later, or to adapt the value of ``method`` to a particular set
		of inputs.
		
		Experiments were run on an Amazon EC2 r5a.2xlarge machine to test this
		function. These experiments measured the ratio between the time required
		when using ``method='auto'`` and the time required for the fastest method
		(i.e., ``ratio = time_auto / min(time_fft, time_direct)``). In these
		experiments, we found:
		
		* There is a 95% chance of this ratio being less than 1.5 for 1D signals
		  and a 99% chance of being less than 2.5 for 2D signals.
		* The ratio was always less than 2.5/5 for 1D/2D signals respectively.
		* This function is most inaccurate for 1D convolutions that take between 1
		  and 10 milliseconds with ``method='direct'``. A good proxy for this
		  (at least in our experiments) is ``1e6 <= in1.size * in2.size <= 1e7``.
		
		The 2D results almost certainly generalize to 3D/4D/etc because the
		implementation is the same (the 1D implementation is different).
		
		All the numbers above are specific to the EC2 machine. However, we did find
		that this function generalizes fairly decently across hardware. The speed
		tests were of similar quality (and even slightly better) than the same
		tests performed on the machine to tune this function's numbers (a mid-2014
		15-inch MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM and a 2.5GHz Intel i7 processor).
		
		There are cases when `fftconvolve` supports the inputs but this function
		returns `direct` (e.g., to protect against floating point integer
		precision).
		
		.. versionadded:: 0.19
		
		Examples
		--------
		Estimate the fastest method for a given input:
		
		>>> from scipy import signal
		>>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
		>>> img = rng.random((32, 32))
		>>> filter = rng.random((8, 8))
		>>> method = signal.choose_conv_method(img, filter, mode='same')
		>>> method
		'fft'
		
		This can then be applied to other arrays of the same dtype and shape:
		
		>>> img2 = rng.random((32, 32))
		>>> filter2 = rng.random((8, 8))
		>>> corr2 = signal.correlate(img2, filter2, mode='same', method=method)
		>>> conv2 = signal.convolve(img2, filter2, mode='same', method=method)
		
		The output of this function (``method``) works with `correlate` and
		`convolve`.

		x : array_like

		nfft : int, optional
		    Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
		    `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
		detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
		    Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
		    string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
		    function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
		    detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
		    done. Defaults to 'constant'.
		axis : int, optional
		    Axis along which the coherence is computed for both inputs; the
		    default is over the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
		
		Returns
		-------
		f : ndarray
		    Array of sample frequencies.
		Cxy : ndarray
		    Magnitude squared coherence of x and y.

		lombscargle: Lomb-Scargle periodogram for unevenly sampled data
		welch: Power spectral density by Welch's method.
		csd: Cross spectral density by Welch's method.
		
		Notes
		-----
		An appropriate amount of overlap will depend on the choice of window
		and on your requirements. For the default Hann window an overlap of
		50% is a reasonable trade off between accurately estimating the
		signal power, while not over counting any of the data. Narrower
		windows may require a larger overlap.

	/**
		Convolve two 2-dimensional arrays.
		
		Convolve `in1` and `in2` with output size determined by `mode`, and

		Parameters
		----------
		in1 : array_like
		    First input.
		in2 : array_like
		    Second input. Should have the same number of dimensions as `in1`.
		mode : str {'full', 'valid', 'same'}, optional
		    A string indicating the size of the output:
		
		    ``full``
		       The output is the full discrete linear convolution
		       of the inputs. (Default)
		    ``valid``
		       The output consists only of those elements that do not
		       rely on the zero-padding. In 'valid' mode, either `in1` or `in2`
		       must be at least as large as the other in every dimension.

		Cross-correlate two N-dimensional arrays.
		
		Cross-correlate `in1` and `in2`, with the output size determined by the
		`mode` argument.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		in1 : array_like
		    First input.
		in2 : array_like
		    Second input. Should have the same number of dimensions as `in1`.
		mode : str {'full', 'valid', 'same'}, optional

		method : str {'auto', 'direct', 'fft'}, optional
		    A string indicating which method to use to calculate the correlation.
		
		    ``direct``
		       The correlation is determined directly from sums, the definition of
		       correlation.
		    ``fft``
		       The Fast Fourier Transform is used to perform the correlation more
		       quickly (only available for numerical arrays.)
		    ``auto``
		       Automatically chooses direct or Fourier method based on an estimate
		       of which is faster (default).  See `convolve` Notes for more detail.
		
		       .. versionadded:: 0.19.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		correlate : array
		    An N-dimensional array containing a subset of the discrete linear
		    cross-correlation of `in1` with `in2`.
		
		See Also
		--------
		choose_conv_method : contains more documentation on `method`.
		correlation_lags : calculates the lag / displacement indices array for 1D
		    cross-correlation.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The correlation z of two d-dimensional arrays x and y is defined as::
		
		    z[...,k,...] = sum[..., i_l, ...] x[..., i_l,...] * conj(y[..., i_l - k,...])
		
		This way, if x and y are 1-D arrays and ``z = correlate(x, y, 'full')``
		then
		
		.. math::
		
		      z[k] = (x * y)(k - N + 1)
		           = \sum_{l=0}^{||x||-1}x_l y_{l-k+N-1}^{*}
		
		for :math:`k = 0, 1, ..., ||x|| + ||y|| - 2`
		
		where :math:`||x||` is the length of ``x``, :math:`N = \max(||x||,||y||)`,
		and :math:`y_m` is 0 when m is outside the range of y.
		
		``method='fft'`` only works for numerical arrays as it relies on
		`fftconvolve`. In certain cases (i.e., arrays of objects or when
		rounding integers can lose precision), ``method='direct'`` is always used.
		
		When using "same" mode with even-length inputs, the outputs of `correlate`
		and `correlate2d` differ: There is a 1-index offset between them.

		--------

		Estimate the cross power spectral density, Pxy, using Welch's method.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Time series of measurement values
		y : array_like
		    Time series of measurement values
		fs : float, optional
		    Sampling frequency of the `x` and `y` time series. Defaults
		    to 1.0.
		window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
		    Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
		    passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
		    DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
		    required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
		    directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
		    to a Hann window.
		nperseg : int, optional
		    Length of each segment. Defaults to None, but if window is str or
		    tuple, is set to 256, and if window is array_like, is set to the
		    length of the window.
		noverlap: int, optional
		    Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
		    ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``. Defaults to `None`.
		nfft : int, optional
		    Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
		    `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
		detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
		    Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
		    string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
		    function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
		    detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
		    done. Defaults to 'constant'.
		return_onesided : bool, optional
		    If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If
		    `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for
		    complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.
		scaling : { 'density', 'spectrum' }, optional
		    Selects between computing the cross spectral density ('density')
		    where `Pxy` has units of V**2/Hz and computing the cross spectrum
		    ('spectrum') where `Pxy` has units of V**2, if `x` and `y` are
		    measured in V and `fs` is measured in Hz. Defaults to 'density'
		axis : int, optional
		    Axis along which the CSD is computed for both inputs; the
		    default is over the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
		average : { 'mean', 'median' }, optional
		    Method to use when averaging periodograms. If the spectrum is
		    complex, the average is computed separately for the real and
		    imaginary parts. Defaults to 'mean'.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.2.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		f : ndarray
		    Array of sample frequencies.
		Pxy : ndarray
		    Cross spectral density or cross power spectrum of x,y.
		
		See Also
		--------
		periodogram: Simple, optionally modified periodogram
		lombscargle: Lomb-Scargle periodogram for unevenly sampled data
		welch: Power spectral density by Welch's method. [Equivalent to
		       csd(x,x)]
		coherence: Magnitude squared coherence by Welch's method.
		
		Notes
		-----
		By convention, Pxy is computed with the conjugate FFT of X
		multiplied by the FFT of Y.
		
		If the input series differ in length, the shorter series will be
		zero-padded to match.
		
		An appropriate amount of overlap will depend on the choice of window
		and on your requirements. For the default Hann window an overlap of
		50% is a reasonable trade off between accurately estimating the
		signal power, while not over counting any of the data. Narrower
		windows may require a larger overlap.

	/**
		Continuous wavelet transform.
		
		Performs a continuous wavelet transform on `data`,
		using the `wavelet` function. A CWT performs a convolution
		with `data` using the `wavelet` function, which is characterized
		by a width parameter and length parameter. The `wavelet` function
		is allowed to be complex.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		data : (N,) ndarray
		    data on which to perform the transform.
		wavelet : function
		    Wavelet function, which should take 2 arguments.
		    The first argument is the number of points that the returned vector
		    will have (len(wavelet(length,width)) == length).
		    The second is a width parameter, defining the size of the wavelet
		    (e.g. standard deviation of a gaussian). See `ricker`, which
		    satisfies these requirements.
		widths : (M,) sequence
		    Widths to use for transform.
		dtype : data-type, optional
		    The desired data type of output. Defaults to ``float64`` if the
		    output of `wavelet` is real and ``complex128`` if it is complex.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0
		
		kwargs
		    Keyword arguments passed to wavelet function.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		cwt: (M, N) ndarray
		    Will have shape of (len(widths), len(data)).
		
		Notes
		-----
		
		.. versionadded:: 1.4.0
		
		For non-symmetric, complex-valued wavelets, the input signal is convolved
		with the time-reversed complex-conjugate of the wavelet data [1].

		Compute the frequency response around a spiral in the Z plane.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array
		    The signal to transform.
		m : int, optional
		    The number of output points desired.  Default is the length of the
		    input data.
		w : complex, optional
		    The ratio between points in each step.  This must be precise or the

		    Defaults to equally spaced points around the entire unit circle.
		a : complex, optional
		    The starting point in the complex plane.  Default is 1+0j.
		axis : int, optional
		    Axis over which to compute the FFT. If not given, the last axis is
		    used.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray
		    An array of the same dimensions as `x`, but with the length of the

		CZT : Class that creates a callable chirp z-transform function.
		zoom_fft : Convenience function for partial FFT calculations.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The defaults are chosen such that ``signal.czt(x)`` is equivalent to
		``fft.fft(x)`` and, if ``m > len(x)``, that ``signal.czt(x, m)`` is
		equivalent to ``fft.fft(x, m)``.
		
		If the transform needs to be repeated, use `CZT` to construct a
		specialized transform function which can be reused without
		recomputing constants.
		
		An example application is in system identification, repeatedly evaluating
		small slices of the z-transform of a system, around where a pole is
		expected to exist, to refine the estimate of the pole's true location. [1]_

		Examples
		--------
		Generate a sinusoid:
		
		>>> f1, f2, fs = 8, 10, 200  # Hz
		>>> t = np.linspace(0, 1, fs, endpoint=False)
		>>> x = np.sin(2*np.pi*t*f2)
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> plt.plot(t, x)
		>>> plt.axis([0, 1, -1.1, 1.1])
		>>> plt.show()
		
		Its discrete Fourier transform has all of its energy in a single frequency
		bin:
		
		>>> from scipy.fft import rfft, rfftfreq
		>>> from scipy.signal import czt, czt_points
		>>> plt.plot(rfftfreq(fs, 1/fs), abs(rfft(x)))
		>>> plt.margins(0, 0.1)
		>>> plt.show()
		
		However, if the sinusoid is logarithmically-decaying:
		
		>>> x = np.exp(-t*f1) * np.sin(2*np.pi*t*f2)
		>>> plt.plot(t, x)
		>>> plt.axis([0, 1, -1.1, 1.1])
		>>> plt.show()
		
		the DFT will have spectral leakage:
		
		>>> plt.plot(rfftfreq(fs, 1/fs), abs(rfft(x)))
		>>> plt.margins(0, 0.1)
		>>> plt.show()
		
		While the DFT always samples the z-transform around the unit circle, the
		chirp z-transform allows us to sample the Z-transform along any
		logarithmic spiral, such as a circle with radius smaller than unity:
		
		>>> M = fs // 2  # Just positive frequencies, like rfft
		>>> a = np.exp(-f1/fs)  # Starting point of the circle, radius < 1
		>>> w = np.exp(-1j*np.pi/M)  # "Step size" of circle
		>>> points = czt_points(M + 1, w, a)  # M + 1 to include Nyquist
		>>> plt.plot(points.real, points.imag, '.')
		>>> plt.gca().add_patch(plt.Circle((0,0), radius=1, fill=False, alpha=.3))
		>>> plt.axis('equal'); plt.axis([-1.05, 1.05, -0.05, 1.05])
		>>> plt.show()
		
		With the correct radius, this transforms the decaying sinusoid (and others
		with the same decay rate) without spectral leakage:
		
		>>> z_vals = czt(x, M + 1, w, a)  # Include Nyquist for comparison to rfft
		>>> freqs = np.angle(points)*fs/(2*np.pi)  # angle = omega, radius = sigma
		>>> plt.plot(freqs, abs(z_vals))

	/**
		Elliptic (Cauer) digital and analog filter design.
		
		Design an Nth-order digital or analog elliptic filter and return
		the filter coefficients.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		N : int
		    The order of the filter.
		rp : float
		    The maximum ripple allowed below unity gain in the passband.
		    Specified in decibels, as a positive number.
		rs : float
		    The minimum attenuation required in the stop band.
		    Specified in decibels, as a positive number.
		Wn : array_like
		    A scalar or length-2 sequence giving the critical frequencies.
		    For elliptic filters, this is the point in the transition band at
		    which the gain first drops below -`rp`.
		
		    For digital filters, `Wn` are in the same units as `fs`. By default,
		    `fs` is 2 half-cycles/sample, so these are normalized from 0 to 1,
		    where 1 is the Nyquist frequency. (`Wn` is thus in
		    half-cycles / sample.)
		
		    For analog filters, `Wn` is an angular frequency (e.g., rad/s).
		btype : {'lowpass', 'highpass', 'bandpass', 'bandstop'}, optional
		    The type of filter. Default is 'lowpass'.
		analog : bool, optional
		    When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is
		    returned.
		output : {'ba', 'zpk', 'sos'}, optional
		    Type of output:  numerator/denominator ('ba'), pole-zero ('zpk'), or
		    second-order sections ('sos'). Default is 'ba' for backwards
		    compatibility, but 'sos' should be used for general-purpose filtering.
		fs : float, optional
		    The sampling frequency of the digital system.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.2.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		b, a : ndarray, ndarray
		    Numerator (`b`) and denominator (`a`) polynomials of the IIR filter.
		    Only returned if ``output='ba'``.
		z, p, k : ndarray, ndarray, float
		    Zeros, poles, and system gain of the IIR filter transfer
		    function.  Only returned if ``output='zpk'``.
		sos : ndarray
		    Second-order sections representation of the IIR filter.
		    Only returned if ``output=='sos'``.
		
		See Also
		--------
		ellipord, ellipap
		
		Notes
		-----
		Also known as Cauer or Zolotarev filters, the elliptical filter maximizes
		the rate of transition between the frequency response's passband and
		stopband, at the expense of ripple in both, and increased ringing in the
		step response.
		
		As `rp` approaches 0, the elliptical filter becomes a Chebyshev
		type II filter (`cheby2`). As `rs` approaches 0, it becomes a Chebyshev
		type I filter (`cheby1`). As both approach 0, it becomes a Butterworth
		filter (`butter`).
		
		The equiripple passband has N maxima or minima (for example, a
		5th-order filter has 3 maxima and 2 minima). Consequently, the DC gain is
		unity for odd-order filters, or -rp dB for even-order filters.
		
		The ``'sos'`` output parameter was added in 0.16.0.
		
		Examples
		--------
		Design an analog filter and plot its frequency response, showing the
		critical points:
		
		>>> from scipy import signal
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		
		>>> b, a = signal.ellip(4, 5, 40, 100, 'low', analog=True)
		>>> w, h = signal.freqs(b, a)
		>>> plt.semilogx(w, 20 * np.log10(abs(h)))
		>>> plt.title('Elliptic filter frequency response (rp=5, rs=40)')
		>>> plt.xlabel('Frequency [radians / second]')
		>>> plt.ylabel('Amplitude [dB]')
		>>> plt.margins(0, 0.1)
		>>> plt.grid(which='both', axis='both')
		>>> plt.axvline(100, color='green') # cutoff frequency
		>>> plt.axhline(-40, color='green') # rs
		>>> plt.axhline(-5, color='green') # rp
		>>> plt.show()
		
		Generate a signal made up of 10 Hz and 20 Hz, sampled at 1 kHz
		
		>>> t = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000, False)  # 1 second
		>>> sig = np.sin(2*np.pi*10*t) + np.sin(2*np.pi*20*t)
		>>> fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)
		>>> ax1.plot(t, sig)
		>>> ax1.set_title('10 Hz and 20 Hz sinusoids')
		>>> ax1.axis([0, 1, -2, 2])
		
		Design a digital high-pass filter at 17 Hz to remove the 10 Hz tone, and
		apply it to the signal. (It's recommended to use second-order sections
		format when filtering, to avoid numerical error with transfer function
		(``ba``) format):
		
		>>> sos = signal.ellip(8, 1, 100, 17, 'hp', fs=1000, output='sos')
		>>> filtered = signal.sosfilt(sos, sig)
		>>> ax2.plot(t, filtered)
		>>> ax2.set_title('After 17 Hz high-pass filter')
		>>> ax2.axis([0, 1, -2, 2])
		>>> ax2.set_xlabel('Time [seconds]')

		Apply a digital filter forward and backward to a signal.
		
		This function applies a linear digital filter twice, once forward and

		twice that of the original.
		
		The function provides options for handling the edges of the signal.
		
		The function `sosfiltfilt` (and filter design using ``output='sos'``)
		should be preferred over `filtfilt` for most filtering tasks, as
		second-order sections have fewer numerical problems.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		b : (N,) array_like
		    The numerator coefficient vector of the filter.
		a : (N,) array_like
		    The denominator coefficient vector of the filter.  If ``a[0]``
		    is not 1, then both `a` and `b` are normalized by ``a[0]``.
		x : array_like
		    The array of data to be filtered.
		axis : int, optional
		    The axis of `x` to which the filter is applied.
		    Default is -1.
		padtype : str or None, optional
		    Must be 'odd', 'even', 'constant', or None.  This determines the
		    type of extension to use for the padded signal to which the filter
		    is applied.  If `padtype` is None, no padding is used.  The default
		    is 'odd'.
		padlen : int or None, optional
		    The number of elements by which to extend `x` at both ends of
		    `axis` before applying the filter.  This value must be less than
		    ``x.shape[axis] - 1``.  ``padlen=0`` implies no padding.
		    The default value is ``3 * max(len(a), len(b))``.
		method : str, optional
		    Determines the method for handling the edges of the signal, either
		    "pad" or "gust".  When `method` is "pad", the signal is padded; the
		    type of padding is determined by `padtype` and `padlen`, and `irlen`
		    is ignored.  When `method` is "gust", Gustafsson's method is used,
		    and `padtype` and `padlen` are ignored.
		irlen : int or None, optional
		    When `method` is "gust", `irlen` specifies the length of the
		    impulse response of the filter.  If `irlen` is None, no part
		    of the impulse response is ignored.  For a long signal, specifying
		    `irlen` can significantly improve the performance of the filter.
		
		Returns
		-------
		y : ndarray
		    The filtered output with the same shape as `x`.
		
		See Also
		--------
		sosfiltfilt, lfilter_zi, lfilter, lfiltic, savgol_filter, sosfilt
		
		Notes
		-----
		When `method` is "pad", the function pads the data along the given axis
		in one of three ways: odd, even or constant.  The odd and even extensions
		have the corresponding symmetry about the end point of the data.  The
		constant extension extends the data with the values at the end points. On
		both the forward and backward passes, the initial condition of the
		filter is found by using `lfilter_zi` and scaling it by the end point of
		the extended data.
		
		When `method` is "gust", Gustafsson's method [1]_ is used.  Initial
		conditions are chosen for the forward and backward passes so that the
		forward-backward filter gives the same result as the backward-forward
		filter.
		
		The option to use Gustaffson's method was added in scipy version 0.16.0.
		
		References
		----------
		.. [1] F. Gustaffson, "Determining the initial states in forward-backward
		       filtering", Transactions on Signal Processing, Vol. 46, pp. 988-992,
		       1996.
		
		Examples
		--------
		The examples will use several functions from `scipy.signal`.
		
		>>> from scipy import signal
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		
		First we create a one second signal that is the sum of two pure sine
		waves, with frequencies 5 Hz and 250 Hz, sampled at 2000 Hz.
		
		>>> t = np.linspace(0, 1.0, 2001)
		>>> xlow = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 5 * t)
		>>> xhigh = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 250 * t)
		>>> x = xlow + xhigh
		
		Now create a lowpass Butterworth filter with a cutoff of 0.125 times
		the Nyquist frequency, or 125 Hz, and apply it to ``x`` with `filtfilt`.
		The result should be approximately ``xlow``, with no phase shift.
		
		>>> b, a = signal.butter(8, 0.125)
		>>> y = signal.filtfilt(b, a, x, padlen=150)
		>>> np.abs(y - xlow).max()
		9.1086182074789912e-06
		
		We get a fairly clean result for this artificial example because
		the odd extension is exact, and with the moderately long padding,
		the filter's transients have dissipated by the time the actual data
		is reached.  In general, transient effects at the edges are
		unavoidable.
		
		The following example demonstrates the option ``method="gust"``.
		
		First, create a filter.
		
		>>> b, a = signal.ellip(4, 0.01, 120, 0.125)  # Filter to be applied.
		
		`sig` is a random input signal to be filtered.
		
		>>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
		>>> n = 60
		>>> sig = rng.standard_normal(n)**3 + 3*rng.standard_normal(n).cumsum()
		
		Apply `filtfilt` to `sig`, once using the Gustafsson method, and
		once using padding, and plot the results for comparison.
		
		>>> fgust = signal.filtfilt(b, a, sig, method="gust")
		>>> fpad = signal.filtfilt(b, a, sig, padlen=50)
		>>> plt.plot(sig, 'k-', label='input')
		>>> plt.plot(fgust, 'b-', linewidth=4, label='gust')
		>>> plt.plot(fpad, 'c-', linewidth=1.5, label='pad')
		>>> plt.legend(loc='best')
		>>> plt.show()
		
		The `irlen` argument can be used to improve the performance
		of Gustafsson's method.
		
		Estimate the impulse response length of the filter.
		
		>>> z, p, k = signal.tf2zpk(b, a)
		>>> eps = 1e-9
		>>> r = np.max(np.abs(p))
		>>> approx_impulse_len = int(np.ceil(np.log(eps) / np.log(r)))
		>>> approx_impulse_len
		137
		
		Apply the filter to a longer signal, with and without the `irlen`
		argument.  The difference between `y1` and `y2` is small.  For long
		signals, using `irlen` gives a significant performance improvement.
		
		>>> x = rng.standard_normal(5000)
		>>> y1 = signal.filtfilt(b, a, x, method='gust')
		>>> y2 = signal.filtfilt(b, a, x, method='gust', irlen=approx_impulse_len)
		>>> print(np.max(np.abs(y1 - y2)))

		Returns
		-------
		peaks : ndarray
		    Indices of peaks in `x` that satisfy all given conditions.
		properties : dict
		    A dictionary containing properties of the returned peaks which were
		    calculated as intermediate results during evaluation of the specified
		    conditions:
		
		    * 'peak_heights'
		          If `height` is given, the height of each peak in `x`.
		    * 'left_thresholds', 'right_thresholds'
		          If `threshold` is given, these keys contain a peaks vertical
		          distance to its neighbouring samples.
		    * 'prominences', 'right_bases', 'left_bases'
		          If `prominence` is given, these keys are accessible. See
		          `peak_prominences` for a description of their content.
		    * 'width_heights', 'left_ips', 'right_ips'
		          If `width` is given, these keys are accessible. See `peak_widths`
		          for a description of their content.
		    * 'plateau_sizes', left_edges', 'right_edges'
		          If `plateau_size` is given, these keys are accessible and contain
		          the indices of a peak's edges (edges are still part of the
		          plateau) and the calculated plateau sizes.
		
		          .. versionadded:: 1.2.0
		
		    To calculate and return properties without excluding peaks, provide the
		    open interval ``(None, None)`` as a value to the appropriate argument
		    (excluding `distance`).
		
		Warns
		-----
		PeakPropertyWarning
		    Raised if a peak's properties have unexpected values (see
		    `peak_prominences` and `peak_widths`).
		
		Warnings
		--------
		This function may return unexpected results for data containing NaNs. To
		avoid this, NaNs should either be removed or replaced.
		
		See Also
		--------
		find_peaks_cwt
		    Find peaks using the wavelet transformation.
		peak_prominences
		    Directly calculate the prominence of peaks.
		peak_widths
		    Directly calculate the width of peaks.
		
		Notes
		-----
		In the context of this function, a peak or local maximum is defined as any
		sample whose two direct neighbours have a smaller amplitude. For flat peaks
		(more than one sample of equal amplitude wide) the index of the middle
		sample is returned (rounded down in case the number of samples is even).
		For noisy signals the peak locations can be off because the noise might
		change the position of local maxima. In those cases consider smoothing the
		signal before searching for peaks or use other peak finding and fitting
		methods (like `find_peaks_cwt`).
		
		Some additional comments on specifying conditions:
		
		* Almost all conditions (excluding `distance`) can be given as half-open or
		  closed intervals, e.g., ``1`` or ``(1, None)`` defines the half-open
		  interval :math:`[1, \infty]` while ``(None, 1)`` defines the interval
		  :math:`[-\infty, 1]`. The open interval ``(None, None)`` can be specified
		  as well, which returns the matching properties without exclusion of peaks.
		* The border is always included in the interval used to select valid peaks.
		* For several conditions the interval borders can be specified with
		  arrays matching `x` in shape which enables dynamic constrains based on
		  the sample position.
		* The conditions are evaluated in the following order: `plateau_size`,
		  `height`, `threshold`, `distance`, `prominence`, `width`. In most cases
		  this order is the fastest one because faster operations are applied first
		  to reduce the number of peaks that need to be evaluated later.
		* While indices in `peaks` are guaranteed to be at least `distance` samples
		  apart, edges of flat peaks may be closer than the allowed `distance`.
		* Use `wlen` to reduce the time it takes to evaluate the conditions for
		  `prominence` or `width` if `x` is large or has many local maxima
		  (see `peak_prominences`).

		Examples
		--------
		To demonstrate this function's usage we use a signal `x` supplied with
		SciPy (see `scipy.misc.electrocardiogram`). Let's find all peaks (local
		maxima) in `x` whose amplitude lies above 0.
		
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> from scipy.misc import electrocardiogram
		>>> from scipy.signal import find_peaks
		>>> x = electrocardiogram()[2000:4000]
		>>> peaks, _ = find_peaks(x, height=0)
		>>> plt.plot(x)
		>>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
		>>> plt.plot(np.zeros_like(x), "--", color="gray")
		>>> plt.show()
		
		We can select peaks below 0 with ``height=(None, 0)`` or use arrays matching
		`x` in size to reflect a changing condition for different parts of the
		signal.
		
		>>> border = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 3 * np.pi, x.size))
		>>> peaks, _ = find_peaks(x, height=(-border, border))
		>>> plt.plot(x)
		>>> plt.plot(-border, "--", color="gray")
		>>> plt.plot(border, ":", color="gray")
		>>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
		>>> plt.show()
		
		Another useful condition for periodic signals can be given with the
		`distance` argument. In this case, we can easily select the positions of
		QRS complexes within the electrocardiogram (ECG) by demanding a distance of
		at least 150 samples.
		
		>>> peaks, _ = find_peaks(x, distance=150)
		>>> np.diff(peaks)
		array([186, 180, 177, 171, 177, 169, 167, 164, 158, 162, 172])
		>>> plt.plot(x)
		>>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
		>>> plt.show()
		
		Especially for noisy signals peaks can be easily grouped by their
		prominence (see `peak_prominences`). E.g., we can select all peaks except
		for the mentioned QRS complexes by limiting the allowed prominence to 0.6.
		
		>>> peaks, properties = find_peaks(x, prominence=(None, 0.6))
		>>> properties["prominences"].max()
		0.5049999999999999
		>>> plt.plot(x)
		>>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
		>>> plt.show()
		
		And, finally, let's examine a different section of the ECG which contains
		beat forms of different shape. To select only the atypical heart beats, we
		combine two conditions: a minimal prominence of 1 and width of at least 20
		samples.
		
		>>> x = electrocardiogram()[17000:18000]
		>>> peaks, properties = find_peaks(x, prominence=1, width=20)
		>>> properties["prominences"], properties["widths"]
		(array([1.495, 2.3  ]), array([36.93773946, 39.32723577]))
		>>> plt.plot(x)
		>>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
		>>> plt.vlines(x=peaks, ymin=x[peaks] - properties["prominences"],
		...            ymax = x[peaks], color = "C1")
		>>> plt.hlines(y=properties["width_heights"], xmin=properties["left_ips"],
		...            xmax=properties["right_ips"], color = "C1")
		>>> plt.show()

	/**
		Find peaks in a 1-D array with wavelet transformation.
		
		The general approach is to smooth `vector` by convolving it with
		`wavelet(width)` for each width in `widths`. Relative maxima which
		appear at enough length scales, and with sufficiently high SNR, are
		accepted.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		vector : ndarray
		    1-D array in which to find the peaks.
		widths : float or sequence
		    Single width or 1-D array-like of widths to use for calculating
		    the CWT matrix. In general,
		    this range should cover the expected width of peaks of interest.
		wavelet : callable, optional
		    Should take two parameters and return a 1-D array to convolve
		    with `vector`. The first parameter determines the number of points
		    of the returned wavelet array, the second parameter is the scale
		    (`width`) of the wavelet. Should be normalized and symmetric.
		    Default is the ricker wavelet.
		max_distances : ndarray, optional
		    At each row, a ridge line is only connected if the relative max at
		    row[n] is within ``max_distances[n]`` from the relative max at
		    ``row[n+1]``.  Default value is ``widths/4``.
		gap_thresh : float, optional
		    If a relative maximum is not found within `max_distances`,
		    there will be a gap. A ridge line is discontinued if there are more
		    than `gap_thresh` points without connecting a new relative maximum.
		    Default is the first value of the widths array i.e. widths[0].
		min_length : int, optional
		    Minimum length a ridge line needs to be acceptable.
		    Default is ``cwt.shape[0] / 4``, ie 1/4-th the number of widths.
		min_snr : float, optional
		    Minimum SNR ratio. Default 1. The signal is the value of
		    the cwt matrix at the shortest length scale (``cwt[0, loc]``), the
		    noise is the `noise_perc`th percentile of datapoints contained within a
		    window of `window_size` around ``cwt[0, loc]``.
		noise_perc : float, optional
		    When calculating the noise floor, percentile of data points
		    examined below which to consider noise. Calculated using
		    `stats.scoreatpercentile`.  Default is 10.
		window_size : int, optional
		    Size of window to use to calculate noise floor.
		    Default is ``cwt.shape[1] / 20``.
		
		Returns
		-------
		peaks_indices : ndarray
		    Indices of the locations in the `vector` where peaks were found.
		    The list is sorted.
		
		See Also
		--------
		cwt
		    Continuous wavelet transform.
		find_peaks
		    Find peaks inside a signal based on peak properties.
		
		Notes
		-----
		This approach was designed for finding sharp peaks among noisy data,
		however with proper parameter selection it should function well for
		different peak shapes.
		
		The algorithm is as follows:
		 1. Perform a continuous wavelet transform on `vector`, for the supplied
		    `widths`. This is a convolution of `vector` with `wavelet(width)` for
		    each width in `widths`. See `cwt`.
		 2. Identify "ridge lines" in the cwt matrix. These are relative maxima
		    at each row, connected across adjacent rows. See identify_ridge_lines
		 3. Filter the ridge_lines using filter_ridge_lines.

		FIR filter design using the window method.
		
		This function computes the coefficients of a finite impulse response
		filter. The filter will have linear phase; it will be Type I if
		`numtaps` is odd and Type II if `numtaps` is even.
		
		Type II filters always have zero response at the Nyquist frequency, so a
		ValueError exception is raised if firwin is called with `numtaps` even and
		having a passband whose right end is at the Nyquist frequency.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		numtaps : int
		    Length of the filter (number of coefficients, i.e. the filter
		    order + 1).  `numtaps` must be odd if a passband includes the
		    Nyquist frequency.
		cutoff : float or 1-D array_like
		    Cutoff frequency of filter (expressed in the same units as `fs`)
		    OR an array of cutoff frequencies (that is, band edges). In the
		    latter case, the frequencies in `cutoff` should be positive and
		    monotonically increasing between 0 and `fs/2`. The values 0 and
		    `fs/2` must not be included in `cutoff`.
		width : float or None, optional
		    If `width` is not None, then assume it is the approximate width
		    of the transition region (expressed in the same units as `fs`)
		    for use in Kaiser FIR filter design. In this case, the `window`
		    argument is ignored.
		window : string or tuple of string and parameter values, optional
		    Desired window to use. See `scipy.signal.get_window` for a list
		    of windows and required parameters.
		pass_zero : {True, False, 'bandpass', 'lowpass', 'highpass', 'bandstop'}, optional
		    If True, the gain at the frequency 0 (i.e., the "DC gain") is 1.
		    If False, the DC gain is 0. Can also be a string argument for the
		    desired filter type (equivalent to ``btype`` in IIR design functions).
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.3.0
		       Support for string arguments.
		scale : bool, optional
		    Set to True to scale the coefficients so that the frequency
		    response is exactly unity at a certain frequency.
		    That frequency is either:
		
		    - 0 (DC) if the first passband starts at 0 (i.e. pass_zero
		      is True)
		    - `fs/2` (the Nyquist frequency) if the first passband ends at
		      `fs/2` (i.e the filter is a single band highpass filter);
		      center of first passband otherwise
		
		nyq : float, optional
		    *Deprecated. Use `fs` instead.* This is the Nyquist frequency.
		    Each frequency in `cutoff` must be between 0 and `nyq`. Default
		    is 1.
		fs : float, optional
		    The sampling frequency of the signal. Each frequency in `cutoff`
		    must be between 0 and ``fs/2``.  Default is 2.
		
		Returns
		-------
		h : (numtaps,) ndarray
		    Coefficients of length `numtaps` FIR filter.
		
		Raises
		------
		ValueError
		    If any value in `cutoff` is less than or equal to 0 or greater
		    than or equal to ``fs/2``, if the values in `cutoff` are not strictly

		    The filter gains at the frequency sampling points. Certain
		    constraints to gain values, depending on the filter type, are applied,
		    see Notes for details.
		nfreqs : int, optional
		    The size of the interpolation mesh used to construct the filter.
		    For most efficient behavior, this should be a power of 2 plus 1
		    (e.g, 129, 257, etc). The default is one more than the smallest
		    power of 2 that is not less than `numtaps`. `nfreqs` must be greater
		    than `numtaps`.
		window : string or (string, float) or float, or None, optional
		    Window function to use. Default is "hamming". See
		    `scipy.signal.get_window` for the complete list of possible values.
		    If None, no window function is applied.
		nyq : float, optional
		    *Deprecated. Use `fs` instead.* This is the Nyquist frequency.
		    Each frequency in `freq` must be between 0 and `nyq`.  Default is 1.
		antisymmetric : bool, optional
		    Whether resulting impulse response is symmetric/antisymmetric.
		    See Notes for more details.
		fs : float, optional
		    The sampling frequency of the signal. Each frequency in `cutoff`
		    must be between 0 and ``fs/2``. Default is 2.
		
		Returns
		-------
		taps : ndarray
		    The filter coefficients of the FIR filter, as a 1-D array of length
		    `numtaps`.

		Notes
		-----
		From the given set of frequencies and gains, the desired response is
		constructed in the frequency domain. The inverse FFT is applied to the
		desired response to create the associated convolution kernel, and the
		first `numtaps` coefficients of this kernel, scaled by `window`, are
		returned.
		
		The FIR filter will have linear phase. The type of filter is determined by
		the value of 'numtaps` and `antisymmetric` flag.
		There are four possible combinations:
		
		   - odd  `numtaps`, `antisymmetric` is False, type I filter is produced
		   - even `numtaps`, `antisymmetric` is False, type II filter is produced
		   - odd  `numtaps`, `antisymmetric` is True, type III filter is produced
		   - even `numtaps`, `antisymmetric` is True, type IV filter is produced
		
		Magnitude response of all but type I filters are subjects to following
		constraints:
		
		   - type II  -- zero at the Nyquist frequency
		   - type III -- zero at zero and Nyquist frequencies
		   - type IV  -- zero at zero frequency

		----------
		b : array_like

		whole : bool, optional

		fs : float, optional
		    The sampling frequency of the digital system. Defaults to 2*pi

		    .. versionadded:: 1.2.0

		    .. versionadded:: 1.5.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		w : ndarray
		    The frequencies at which `h` was computed, in the same units as `fs`.

		h : ndarray
		    The frequency response, as complex numbers.

		complex transfer function, not the magnitude.
		Try ``lambda w, h: plot(w, np.abs(h))``.
		
		A direct computation via (R)FFT is used to compute the frequency response
		when the following conditions are met:
		
		1. An integer value is given for `worN`.
		2. `worN` is fast to compute via FFT (i.e.,
		   `next_fast_len(worN) <scipy.fft.next_fast_len>` equals `worN`).
		3. The denominator coefficients are a single value (``a.shape[0] == 1``).
		4. `worN` is at least as long as the numerator coefficients
		   (``worN >= b.shape[0]``).
		5. If ``b.ndim > 1``, then ``b.shape[-1] == 1``.
		
		For long FIR filters, the FFT approach can have lower error and be much
		faster than the equivalent direct polynomial calculation.

		Broadcasting Examples
		
		Suppose we have two FIR filters whose coefficients are stored in the
		rows of an array with shape (2, 25). For this demonstration, we'll
		use random data:
		
		>>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
		>>> b = rng.random((2, 25))
		
		To compute the frequency response for these two filters with one call
		to `freqz`, we must pass in ``b.T``, because `freqz` expects the first
		axis to hold the coefficients. We must then extend the shape with a
		trivial dimension of length 1 to allow broadcasting with the array
		of frequencies.  That is, we pass in ``b.T[..., np.newaxis]``, which has
		shape (25, 2, 1):
		
		>>> w, h = signal.freqz(b.T[..., np.newaxis], worN=1024)
		>>> w.shape
		(1024,)
		>>> h.shape
		(2, 1024)
		
		Now, suppose we have two transfer functions, with the same numerator
		coefficients ``b = [0.5, 0.5]``. The coefficients for the two denominators
		are stored in the first dimension of the 2-D array  `a`::
		
		    a = [   1      1  ]
		        [ -0.25, -0.5 ]
		
		>>> b = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
		>>> a = np.array([[1, 1], [-0.25, -0.5]])
		
		Only `a` is more than 1-D. To make it compatible for
		broadcasting with the frequencies, we extend it with a trivial dimension
		in the call to `freqz`:
		
		>>> w, h = signal.freqz(b, a[..., np.newaxis], worN=1024)
		>>> w.shape
		(1024,)
		>>> h.shape
		(2, 1024)

		Compute the group delay of a digital filter.
		
		The group delay measures by how many samples amplitude envelopes of

		w : {None, int, array_like}, optional

		    If an array_like, compute the delay at the frequencies given. These
		    are in the same units as `fs`.
		whole : bool, optional
		    Normally, frequencies are computed from 0 to the Nyquist frequency,
		    fs/2 (upper-half of unit-circle). If `whole` is True, compute
		    frequencies from 0 to fs. Ignored if w is array_like.
		fs : float, optional
		    The sampling frequency of the digital system. Defaults to 2*pi

		w : ndarray

		gd : ndarray
		    The group delay.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The similar function in MATLAB is called `grpdelay`.
		
		If the transfer function :math:`H(z)` has zeros or poles on the unit
		circle, the group delay at corresponding frequencies is undefined.
		When such a case arises the warning is raised and the group delay

		The Hamming was named for R. W. Hamming, an associate of J. W. Tukey and

		Compute the analytic signal, using the Hilbert transform.
		
		The transformation is done along the last axis by default.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Signal data.  Must be real.
		N : int, optional
		    Number of Fourier components.  Default: ``x.shape[axis]``
		axis : int, optional
		    Axis along which to do the transformation.  Default: -1.
		
		Returns
		-------
		xa : ndarray
		    Analytic signal of `x`, of each 1-D array along `axis`
		
		Notes
		-----
		The analytic signal ``x_a(t)`` of signal ``x(t)`` is:
		
		.. math:: x_a = F^{-1}(F(x) 2U) = x + i y
		
		where `F` is the Fourier transform, `U` the unit step function,
		and `y` the Hilbert transform of `x`. [1]_
		
		In other words, the negative half of the frequency spectrum is zeroed
		out, turning the real-valued signal into a complex signal.  The Hilbert
		transformed signal can be obtained from ``np.imag(hilbert(x))``, and the
		original signal from ``np.real(hilbert(x))``.
		
		Examples
		--------
		In this example we use the Hilbert transform to determine the amplitude
		envelope and instantaneous frequency of an amplitude-modulated signal.
		
		>>> import numpy as np
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> from scipy.signal import hilbert, chirp
		
		>>> duration = 1.0
		>>> fs = 400.0
		>>> samples = int(fs*duration)
		>>> t = np.arange(samples) / fs
		
		We create a chirp of which the frequency increases from 20 Hz to 100 Hz and
		apply an amplitude modulation.
		
		>>> signal = chirp(t, 20.0, t[-1], 100.0)
		>>> signal *= (1.0 + 0.5 * np.sin(2.0*np.pi*3.0*t) )
		
		The amplitude envelope is given by magnitude of the analytic signal. The
		instantaneous frequency can be obtained by differentiating the
		instantaneous phase in respect to time. The instantaneous phase corresponds
		to the phase angle of the analytic signal.
		
		>>> analytic_signal = hilbert(signal)
		>>> amplitude_envelope = np.abs(analytic_signal)
		>>> instantaneous_phase = np.unwrap(np.angle(analytic_signal))
		>>> instantaneous_frequency = (np.diff(instantaneous_phase) /
		...                            (2.0*np.pi) * fs)
		
		>>> fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(nrows=2)
		>>> ax0.plot(t, signal, label='signal')
		>>> ax0.plot(t, amplitude_envelope, label='envelope')

	/**
		Design IIR notching or peaking digital comb filter.
		
		A notching comb filter is a band-stop filter with a narrow bandwidth
		(high quality factor). It rejects a narrow frequency band and
		leaves the rest of the spectrum little changed.
		
		A peaking comb filter is a band-pass filter with a narrow bandwidth
		(high quality factor). It rejects components outside a narrow
		frequency band.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		w0 : float
		    Frequency to attenuate (notching) or boost (peaking). If `fs` is
		    specified, this is in the same units as `fs`. By default, it is
		    a normalized scalar that must satisfy  ``0 < w0 < 1``, with
		    ``w0 = 1`` corresponding to half of the sampling frequency.
		Q : float
		    Quality factor. Dimensionless parameter that characterizes
		    notch filter -3 dB bandwidth ``bw`` relative to its center
		    frequency, ``Q = w0/bw``.
		ftype : {'notch', 'peak'}
		    The type of comb filter generated by the function. If 'notch', then
		    it returns a filter with notches at frequencies ``0``, ``w0``,
		    ``2 * w0``, etc. If 'peak', then it returns a filter with peaks at
		    frequencies ``0.5 * w0``, ``1.5 * w0``, ``2.5 * w0```, etc.
		    Default is 'notch'.
		fs : float, optional
		    The sampling frequency of the signal. Default is 2.0.
		
		Returns
		-------
		b, a : ndarray, ndarray
		    Numerator (``b``) and denominator (``a``) polynomials
		    of the IIR filter.
		
		Raises
		------
		ValueError
		    If `w0` is less than or equal to 0 or greater than or equal to
		    ``fs/2``, if `fs` is not divisible by `w0`, if `ftype`
		    is not 'notch' or 'peak'
		
		See Also
		--------
		iirnotch
		iirpeak
		
		Notes
		-----
		For implementation details, see [1]_. The TF implementation of the
		comb filter is numerically stable even at higher orders due to the
		use of a single repeated pole, which won't suffer from precision loss.

		Complete IIR digital and analog filter design.
		
		Given passband and stopband frequencies and gains, construct an analog or
		digital IIR filter of minimum order for a given basic type. Return the
		output in numerator, denominator ('ba'), pole-zero ('zpk') or second order
		sections ('sos') form.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		wp, ws : float or array like, shape (2,)
		    Passband and stopband edge frequencies. Possible values are scalars
		    (for lowpass and highpass filters) or ranges (for bandpass and bandstop
		    filters).
		    For digital filters, these are in the same units as `fs`. By default,
		    `fs` is 2 half-cycles/sample, so these are normalized from 0 to 1,
		    where 1 is the Nyquist frequency. For example:
		
		        - Lowpass:   wp = 0.2,          ws = 0.3
		        - Highpass:  wp = 0.3,          ws = 0.2
		        - Bandpass:  wp = [0.2, 0.5],   ws = [0.1, 0.6]
		        - Bandstop:  wp = [0.1, 0.6],   ws = [0.2, 0.5]
		
		    For analog filters, `wp` and `ws` are angular frequencies (e.g., rad/s).
		    Note, that for bandpass and bandstop filters passband must lie strictly
		    inside stopband or vice versa.
		gpass : float
		    The maximum loss in the passband (dB).
		gstop : float
		    The minimum attenuation in the stopband (dB).
		analog : bool, optional
		    When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is
		    returned.
		ftype : str, optional
		    The type of IIR filter to design:
		
		        - Butterworth   : 'butter'
		        - Chebyshev I   : 'cheby1'
		        - Chebyshev II  : 'cheby2'
		        - Cauer/elliptic: 'ellip'
		        - Bessel/Thomson: 'bessel'
		
		output : {'ba', 'zpk', 'sos'}, optional
		    Filter form of the output:
		
		        - second-order sections (recommended): 'sos'
		        - numerator/denominator (default)    : 'ba'
		        - pole-zero                          : 'zpk'
		
		    In general the second-order sections ('sos') form  is
		    recommended because inferring the coefficients for the
		    numerator/denominator form ('ba') suffers from numerical
		    instabilities. For reasons of backward compatibility the default
		    form is the numerator/denominator form ('ba'), where the 'b'
		    and the 'a' in 'ba' refer to the commonly used names of the
		    coefficients used.
		
		    Note: Using the second-order sections form ('sos') is sometimes
		    associated with additional computational costs: for
		    data-intense use cases it is therefore recommended to also
		    investigate the numerator/denominator form ('ba').
		
		fs : float, optional
		    The sampling frequency of the digital system.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.2.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		b, a : ndarray, ndarray
		    Numerator (`b`) and denominator (`a`) polynomials of the IIR filter.
		    Only returned if ``output='ba'``.
		z, p, k : ndarray, ndarray, float
		    Zeros, poles, and system gain of the IIR filter transfer
		    function.  Only returned if ``output='zpk'``.
		sos : ndarray
		    Second-order sections representation of the IIR filter.
		    Only returned if ``output=='sos'``.

	/**
		Impulse response of a single-input, continuous-time linear system.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		system : an instance of the LTI class or a tuple of array_like
		    describing the system.
		    The following gives the number of elements in the tuple and
		    the interpretation:
		
		        * 1 (instance of `lti`)
		        * 2 (num, den)
		        * 3 (zeros, poles, gain)
		        * 4 (A, B, C, D)
		
		X0 : 1-D array_like, optional
		    The initial condition of the state vector.  Default: 0 (the
		    zero vector).
		T : 1-D array_like, optional
		    The time steps at which the input is defined and at which the
		    output is desired.  If `T` is not given, the function will
		    generate a set of time samples automatically.
		N : int, optional
		    Number of time points to compute.  Default: 100.
		kwargs : various types
		    Additional keyword arguments are passed on to the function
		    `scipy.signal.lsim2`, which in turn passes them on to
		    `scipy.integrate.odeint`; see the latter's documentation for
		    information about these arguments.
		
		Returns
		-------
		T : ndarray
		    The time values for the output.
		yout : ndarray
		    The output response of the system.
		
		See Also
		--------
		impulse, lsim2, scipy.integrate.odeint
		
		Notes
		-----
		The solution is generated by calling `scipy.signal.lsim2`, which uses
		the differential equation solver `scipy.integrate.odeint`.
		
		If (num, den) is passed in for ``system``, coefficients for both the
		numerator and denominator should be specified in descending exponent
		order (e.g. ``s^2 + 3s + 5`` would be represented as ``[1, 3, 5]``).

	/**
		Perform the inverse Short Time Fourier transform (iSTFT).
		
		Parameters
		----------
		Zxx : array_like
		    STFT of the signal to be reconstructed. If a purely real array
		    is passed, it will be cast to a complex data type.
		fs : float, optional
		    Sampling frequency of the time series. Defaults to 1.0.
		window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
		    Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
		    passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
		    DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
		    required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
		    directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
		    to a Hann window. Must match the window used to generate the
		    STFT for faithful inversion.
		nperseg : int, optional
		    Number of data points corresponding to each STFT segment. This
		    parameter must be specified if the number of data points per
		    segment is odd, or if the STFT was padded via ``nfft >
		    nperseg``. If `None`, the value depends on the shape of
		    `Zxx` and `input_onesided`. If `input_onesided` is `True`,
		    ``nperseg=2*(Zxx.shape[freq_axis] - 1)``. Otherwise,
		    ``nperseg=Zxx.shape[freq_axis]``. Defaults to `None`.
		noverlap : int, optional
		    Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`, half
		    of the segment length. Defaults to `None`. When specified, the
		    COLA constraint must be met (see Notes below), and should match
		    the parameter used to generate the STFT. Defaults to `None`.
		nfft : int, optional
		    Number of FFT points corresponding to each STFT segment. This
		    parameter must be specified if the STFT was padded via ``nfft >
		    nperseg``. If `None`, the default values are the same as for
		    `nperseg`, detailed above, with one exception: if
		    `input_onesided` is True and
		    ``nperseg==2*Zxx.shape[freq_axis] - 1``, `nfft` also takes on
		    that value. This case allows the proper inversion of an
		    odd-length unpadded STFT using ``nfft=None``. Defaults to
		    `None`.
		input_onesided : bool, optional
		    If `True`, interpret the input array as one-sided FFTs, such
		    as is returned by `stft` with ``return_onesided=True`` and
		    `numpy.fft.rfft`. If `False`, interpret the input as a a
		    two-sided FFT. Defaults to `True`.
		boundary : bool, optional
		    Specifies whether the input signal was extended at its
		    boundaries by supplying a non-`None` ``boundary`` argument to
		    `stft`. Defaults to `True`.
		time_axis : int, optional
		    Where the time segments of the STFT is located; the default is
		    the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
		freq_axis : int, optional
		    Where the frequency axis of the STFT is located; the default is
		    the penultimate axis (i.e. ``axis=-2``).
		
		Returns
		-------
		t : ndarray
		    Array of output data times.
		x : ndarray
		    iSTFT of `Zxx`.
		
		See Also
		--------
		stft: Short Time Fourier Transform
		check_COLA: Check whether the Constant OverLap Add (COLA) constraint
		            is met
		check_NOLA: Check whether the Nonzero Overlap Add (NOLA) constraint is met
		
		Notes
		-----
		In order to enable inversion of an STFT via the inverse STFT with
		`istft`, the signal windowing must obey the constraint of "nonzero
		overlap add" (NOLA):
		
		.. math:: \sum_{t}w^{2}[n-tH] \ne 0
		
		This ensures that the normalization factors that appear in the denominator
		of the overlap-add reconstruction equation
		
		.. math:: x[n]=\frac{\sum_{t}x_{t}[n]w[n-tH]}{\sum_{t}w^{2}[n-tH]}
		
		are not zero. The NOLA constraint can be checked with the `check_NOLA`
		function.
		
		An STFT which has been modified (via masking or otherwise) is not
		guaranteed to correspond to a exactly realizible signal. This
		function implements the iSTFT via the least-squares estimation
		algorithm detailed in [2]_, which produces a signal that minimizes
		the mean squared error between the STFT of the returned signal and
		the modified STFT.

		The Kaiser window is a taper formed by using a Bessel function.

		    Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an empty
		    array is returned.
		beta : float
		    Shape parameter, determines trade-off between main-lobe width and

		sym : bool, optional
		    When True (default), generates a symmetric window, for use in filter

		Returns
		-------
		w : ndarray
		    The window, with the maximum value normalized to 1 (though the value 1
		    does not appear if `M` is even and `sym` is True).
		
		Notes
		-----
		The Kaiser window is defined as
		
		.. math::  w(n) = I_0\left( \beta \sqrt{1-\frac{4n^2}{(M-1)^2}}
		           \right)/I_0(\beta)
		
		with
		
		.. math:: \quad -\frac{M-1}{2} \leq n \leq \frac{M-1}{2},
		
		where :math:`I_0` is the modified zeroth-order Bessel function.
		
		The Kaiser was named for Jim Kaiser, who discovered a simple approximation
		to the DPSS window based on Bessel functions.
		The Kaiser window is a very good approximation to the Digital Prolate
		Spheroidal Sequence, or Slepian window, which is the transform which
		maximizes the energy in the main lobe of the window relative to total
		energy.
		
		The Kaiser can approximate other windows by varying the beta parameter.
		(Some literature uses alpha = beta/pi.) [4]_
		
		====  =======================
		beta  Window shape
		====  =======================
		0     Rectangular
		5     Similar to a Hamming
		6     Similar to a Hann
		8.6   Similar to a Blackman
		====  =======================
		
		A beta value of 14 is probably a good starting point. Note that as beta
		gets large, the window narrows, and so the number of samples needs to be
		large enough to sample the increasingly narrow spike, otherwise NaNs will
		be returned.
		
		Most references to the Kaiser window come from the signal processing
		literature, where it is used as one of many windowing functions for
		smoothing values.  It is also known as an apodization (which means
		"removing the foot", i.e. smoothing discontinuities at the beginning
		and end of the sampled signal) or tapering function.

		Examples
		--------
		We will use the Kaiser window method to design a lowpass FIR filter
		for a signal that is sampled at 1000 Hz.
		
		We want at least 65 dB rejection in the stop band, and in the pass
		band the gain should vary no more than 0.5%.
		
		We want a cutoff frequency of 175 Hz, with a transition between the
		pass band and the stop band of 24 Hz. That is, in the band [0, 163],
		the gain varies no more than 0.5%, and in the band [187, 500], the
		signal is attenuated by at least 65 dB.
		
		>>> from scipy.signal import kaiserord, firwin, freqz
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> fs = 1000.0
		>>> cutoff = 175
		>>> width = 24
		
		The Kaiser method accepts just a single parameter to control the pass
		band ripple and the stop band rejection, so we use the more restrictive
		of the two. In this case, the pass band ripple is 0.005, or 46.02 dB,
		so we will use 65 dB as the design parameter.
		
		Use `kaiserord` to determine the length of the filter and the
		parameter for the Kaiser window.
		
		>>> numtaps, beta = kaiserord(65, width/(0.5*fs))
		>>> numtaps
		167
		>>> beta
		6.20426
		
		Use `firwin` to create the FIR filter.
		
		>>> taps = firwin(numtaps, cutoff, window=('kaiser', beta),
		...               scale=False, nyq=0.5*fs)
		
		Compute the frequency response of the filter.  ``w`` is the array of
		frequencies, and ``h`` is the corresponding complex array of frequency
		responses.
		
		>>> w, h = freqz(taps, worN=8000)
		>>> w *= 0.5*fs/np.pi  # Convert w to Hz.
		
		Compute the deviation of the magnitude of the filter's response from
		that of the ideal lowpass filter. Values in the transition region are
		set to ``nan``, so they won't appear in the plot.
		
		>>> ideal = w < cutoff  # The "ideal" frequency response.
		>>> deviation = np.abs(np.abs(h) - ideal)
		>>> deviation[(w > cutoff - 0.5*width) & (w < cutoff + 0.5*width)] = np.nan
		
		Plot the deviation. A close look at the left end of the stop band shows
		that the requirement for 65 dB attenuation is violated in the first lobe

	/**
		Filter data along one-dimension with an IIR or FIR filter.
		
		Filter a data sequence, `x`, using a digital filter.  This works for many
		fundamental data types (including Object type).  The filter is a direct
		form II transposed implementation of the standard difference equation
		(see Notes).
		
		The function `sosfilt` (and filter design using ``output='sos'``) should be
		preferred over `lfilter` for most filtering tasks, as second-order sections
		have fewer numerical problems.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		b : array_like
		    The numerator coefficient vector in a 1-D sequence.
		a : array_like
		    The denominator coefficient vector in a 1-D sequence.  If ``a[0]``
		    is not 1, then both `a` and `b` are normalized by ``a[0]``.
		x : array_like
		    An N-dimensional input array.
		axis : int, optional
		    The axis of the input data array along which to apply the
		    linear filter. The filter is applied to each subarray along
		    this axis.  Default is -1.
		zi : array_like, optional
		    Initial conditions for the filter delays.  It is a vector
		    (or array of vectors for an N-dimensional input) of length
		    ``max(len(a), len(b)) - 1``.  If `zi` is None or is not given then
		    initial rest is assumed.  See `lfiltic` for more information.
		
		Returns
		-------
		y : array
		    The output of the digital filter.
		zf : array, optional
		    If `zi` is None, this is not returned, otherwise, `zf` holds the
		    final filter delay values.
		
		See Also
		--------
		lfiltic : Construct initial conditions for `lfilter`.
		lfilter_zi : Compute initial state (steady state of step response) for
		             `lfilter`.
		filtfilt : A forward-backward filter, to obtain a filter with linear phase.
		savgol_filter : A Savitzky-Golay filter.
		sosfilt: Filter data using cascaded second-order sections.
		sosfiltfilt: A forward-backward filter using second-order sections.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The filter function is implemented as a direct II transposed structure.
		This means that the filter implements::
		
		   a[0]*y[n] = b[0]*x[n] + b[1]*x[n-1] + ... + b[M]*x[n-M]
		                         - a[1]*y[n-1] - ... - a[N]*y[n-N]
		
		where `M` is the degree of the numerator, `N` is the degree of the
		denominator, and `n` is the sample number.  It is implemented using
		the following difference equations (assuming M = N)::
		
		     a[0]*y[n] = b[0] * x[n]               + d[0][n-1]
		       d[0][n] = b[1] * x[n] - a[1] * y[n] + d[1][n-1]
		       d[1][n] = b[2] * x[n] - a[2] * y[n] + d[2][n-1]
		     ...
		     d[N-2][n] = b[N-1]*x[n] - a[N-1]*y[n] + d[N-1][n-1]
		     d[N-1][n] = b[N] * x[n] - a[N] * y[n]
		
		where `d` are the state variables.
		
		The rational transfer function describing this filter in the
		z-transform domain is::
		
		                         -1              -M
		             b[0] + b[1]z  + ... + b[M] z
		     Y(z) = -------------------------------- X(z)
		                         -1              -N
		             a[0] + a[1]z  + ... + a[N] z
		
		Examples
		--------
		Generate a noisy signal to be filtered:
		
		>>> from scipy import signal
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
		>>> t = np.linspace(-1, 1, 201)
		>>> x = (np.sin(2*np.pi*0.75*t*(1-t) + 2.1) +
		...      0.1*np.sin(2*np.pi*1.25*t + 1) +
		...      0.18*np.cos(2*np.pi*3.85*t))
		>>> xn = x + rng.standard_normal(len(t)) * 0.08
		
		Create an order 3 lowpass butterworth filter:
		
		>>> b, a = signal.butter(3, 0.05)
		
		Apply the filter to xn.  Use lfilter_zi to choose the initial condition of
		the filter:
		
		>>> zi = signal.lfilter_zi(b, a)
		>>> z, _ = signal.lfilter(b, a, xn, zi=zi*xn[0])
		
		Apply the filter again, to have a result filtered at an order the same as
		filtfilt:
		
		>>> z2, _ = signal.lfilter(b, a, z, zi=zi*z[0])
		
		Use filtfilt to apply the filter:
		
		>>> y = signal.filtfilt(b, a, xn)
		
		Plot the original signal and the various filtered versions:
		
		>>> plt.figure
		>>> plt.plot(t, xn, 'b', alpha=0.75)
		>>> plt.plot(t, z, 'r--', t, z2, 'r', t, y, 'k')
		>>> plt.legend(('noisy signal', 'lfilter, once', 'lfilter, twice',
		...             'filtfilt'), loc='best')

	**/
	static public function lfilter(b:Dynamic, a:Dynamic, x:Dynamic, ?axis:Dynamic, ?zi:Dynamic):Array<Dynamic>;
	/**
		Construct initial conditions for lfilter for step response steady-state.
		
		Compute an initial state `zi` for the `lfilter` function that corresponds
		to the steady state of the step response.
		
		A typical use of this function is to set the initial state so that the
		output of the filter starts at the same value as the first element of
		the signal to be filtered.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		b, a : array_like (1-D)
		    The IIR filter coefficients. See `lfilter` for more
		    information.
		
		Returns
		-------
		zi : 1-D ndarray
		    The initial state for the filter.
		
		See Also
		--------
		lfilter, lfiltic, filtfilt
		
		Notes
		-----
		A linear filter with order m has a state space representation (A, B, C, D),
		for which the output y of the filter can be expressed as::
		
		    z(n+1) = A*z(n) + B*x(n)
		    y(n)   = C*z(n) + D*x(n)
		
		where z(n) is a vector of length m, A has shape (m, m), B has shape
		(m, 1), C has shape (1, m) and D has shape (1, 1) (assuming x(n) is
		a scalar).  lfilter_zi solves::
		
		    zi = A*zi + B
		
		In other words, it finds the initial condition for which the response
		to an input of all ones is a constant.
		
		Given the filter coefficients `a` and `b`, the state space matrices
		for the transposed direct form II implementation of the linear filter,
		which is the implementation used by scipy.signal.lfilter, are::
		
		    A = scipy.linalg.companion(a).T
		    B = b[1:] - a[1:]*b[0]
		
		assuming `a[0]` is 1.0; if `a[0]` is not 1, `a` and `b` are first
		divided by a[0].
		
		Examples
		--------
		The following code creates a lowpass Butterworth filter. Then it
		applies that filter to an array whose values are all 1.0; the
		output is also all 1.0, as expected for a lowpass filter.  If the
		`zi` argument of `lfilter` had not been given, the output would have
		shown the transient signal.
		
		>>> from numpy import array, ones
		>>> from scipy.signal import lfilter, lfilter_zi, butter
		>>> b, a = butter(5, 0.25)
		>>> zi = lfilter_zi(b, a)
		>>> y, zo = lfilter(b, a, ones(10), zi=zi)
		>>> y
		array([1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
		
		Another example:
		
		>>> x = array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
		>>> y, zf = lfilter(b, a, x, zi=zi*x[0])
		>>> y
		array([ 0.5       ,  0.5       ,  0.5       ,  0.49836039,  0.48610528,
		    0.44399389,  0.35505241])
		
		Note that the `zi` argument to `lfilter` was computed using
		`lfilter_zi` and scaled by `x[0]`.  Then the output `y` has no
		transient until the input drops from 0.5 to 0.0.

		lombscargle(x, y, freqs)
		
		Computes the Lomb-Scargle periodogram.
		
		The Lomb-Scargle periodogram was developed by Lomb [1]_ and further
		extended by Scargle [2]_ to find, and test the significance of weak
		periodic signals with uneven temporal sampling.
		
		When *normalize* is False (default) the computed periodogram
		is unnormalized, it takes the value ``(A**2) * N/4`` for a harmonic
		signal with amplitude A for sufficiently large N.
		
		When *normalize* is True the computed periodogram is normalized by
		the residuals of the data around a constant reference model (at zero).
		
		Input arrays should be 1-D and will be cast to float64.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Sample times.
		y : array_like
		    Measurement values.
		freqs : array_like
		    Angular frequencies for output periodogram.
		precenter : bool, optional
		    Pre-center measurement values by subtracting the mean.
		normalize : bool, optional
		    Compute normalized periodogram.
		
		Returns
		-------
		pgram : array_like
		    Lomb-Scargle periodogram.
		
		Raises
		------
		ValueError
		    If the input arrays `x` and `y` do not have the same shape.
		
		Notes
		-----
		This subroutine calculates the periodogram using a slightly
		modified algorithm due to Townsend [3]_ which allows the
		periodogram to be calculated using only a single pass through
		the input arrays for each frequency.
		
		The algorithm running time scales roughly as O(x * freqs) or O(N^2)
		for a large number of samples and frequencies.

		Simulate output of a continuous-time linear system.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		system : an instance of the LTI class or a tuple describing the system.
		    The following gives the number of elements in the tuple and
		    the interpretation:
		
		    * 1: (instance of `lti`)
		    * 2: (num, den)
		    * 3: (zeros, poles, gain)
		    * 4: (A, B, C, D)
		
		U : array_like
		    An input array describing the input at each time `T`
		    (interpolation is assumed between given times).  If there are
		    multiple inputs, then each column of the rank-2 array
		    represents an input.  If U = 0 or None, a zero input is used.
		T : array_like
		    The time steps at which the input is defined and at which the
		    output is desired.  Must be nonnegative, increasing, and equally spaced.
		X0 : array_like, optional
		    The initial conditions on the state vector (zero by default).
		interp : bool, optional
		    Whether to use linear (True, the default) or zero-order-hold (False)
		    interpolation for the input array.
		
		Returns
		-------
		T : 1D ndarray
		    Time values for the output.
		yout : 1D ndarray
		    System response.
		xout : ndarray
		    Time evolution of the state vector.
		
		Notes
		-----
		If (num, den) is passed in for ``system``, coefficients for both the
		numerator and denominator should be specified in descending exponent
		order (e.g. ``s^2 + 3s + 5`` would be represented as ``[1, 3, 5]``).
		
		Examples
		--------
		We'll use `lsim` to simulate an analog Bessel filter applied to
		a signal.
		
		>>> from scipy.signal import bessel, lsim
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		
		Create a low-pass Bessel filter with a cutoff of 12 Hz.
		
		>>> b, a = bessel(N=5, Wn=2*np.pi*12, btype='lowpass', analog=True)
		
		Generate data to which the filter is applied.
		
		>>> t = np.linspace(0, 1.25, 500, endpoint=False)
		
		The input signal is the sum of three sinusoidal curves, with
		frequencies 4 Hz, 40 Hz, and 80 Hz.  The filter should mostly
		eliminate the 40 Hz and 80 Hz components, leaving just the 4 Hz signal.
		
		>>> u = (np.cos(2*np.pi*4*t) + 0.6*np.sin(2*np.pi*40*t) +
		...      0.5*np.cos(2*np.pi*80*t))
		
		Simulate the filter with `lsim`.
		
		>>> tout, yout, xout = lsim((b, a), U=u, T=t)
		
		Plot the result.
		
		>>> plt.plot(t, u, 'r', alpha=0.5, linewidth=1, label='input')

		>>> plt.legend(loc='best', shadow=True, framealpha=1)
		>>> plt.grid(alpha=0.3)
		>>> plt.xlabel('t')
		>>> plt.show()
		
		In a second example, we simulate a double integrator ``y'' = u``, with
		a constant input ``u = 1``.  We'll use the state space representation
		of the integrator.
		
		>>> from scipy.signal import lti
		>>> A = np.array([[0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0]])

		>>> C = np.array([[1.0, 0.0]])

		`t` and `u` define the time and input signal for the system to
		be simulated.
		
		>>> t = np.linspace(0, 5, num=50)
		>>> u = np.ones_like(t)
		
		Compute the simulation, and then plot `y`.  As expected, the plot shows

		Convert a linear-phase FIR filter to minimum phase
		
		Parameters
		----------
		h : array
		    Linear-phase FIR filter coefficients.
		method : {'hilbert', 'homomorphic'}
		    The method to use:
		
		        'homomorphic' (default)
		            This method [4]_ [5]_ works best with filters with an
		            odd number of taps, and the resulting minimum phase filter
		            will have a magnitude response that approximates the square
		            root of the the original filter's magnitude response.
		
		        'hilbert'
		            This method [1]_ is designed to be used with equiripple
		            filters (e.g., from `remez`) with unity or zero gain
		            regions.
		
		n_fft : int
		    The number of points to use for the FFT. Should be at least a
		    few times larger than the signal length (see Notes).
		
		Returns
		-------
		h_minimum : array
		    The minimum-phase version of the filter, with length
		    ``(length(h) + 1) // 2``.
		
		See Also
		--------
		firwin
		firwin2
		remez
		
		Notes
		-----
		Both the Hilbert [1]_ or homomorphic [4]_ [5]_ methods require selection
		of an FFT length to estimate the complex cepstrum of the filter.
		
		In the case of the Hilbert method, the deviation from the ideal
		spectrum ``epsilon`` is related to the number of stopband zeros
		``n_stop`` and FFT length ``n_fft`` as::
		
		    epsilon = 2. * n_stop / n_fft
		
		For example, with 100 stopband zeros and a FFT length of 2048,
		``epsilon = 0.0976``. If we conservatively assume that the number of
		stopband zeros is one less than the filter length, we can take the FFT
		length to be the next power of 2 that satisfies ``epsilon=0.01`` as::
		
		    n_fft = 2 ** int(np.ceil(np.log2(2 * (len(h) - 1) / 0.01)))
		
		This gives reasonable results for both the Hilbert and homomorphic
		methods, and gives the value used when ``n_fft=None``.
		
		Alternative implementations exist for creating minimum-phase filters,
		including zero inversion [2]_ and spectral factorization [3]_ [4]_.
		For more information, see:
		
		    http://dspguru.com/dsp/howtos/how-to-design-minimum-phase-fir-filters

		Notes
		-----
		The standard version::
		
		    pi**-0.25 * exp(1j*w*x) * exp(-0.5*(x**2))
		
		This commonly used wavelet is often referred to simply as the
		Morlet wavelet.  Note that this simplified version can cause
		admissibility problems at low values of `w`.
		
		The complete version::
		
		    pi**-0.25 * (exp(1j*w*x) - exp(-0.5*(w**2))) * exp(-0.5*(x**2))
		
		This version has a correction
		term to improve admissibility. For `w` greater than 5, the
		correction term is negligible.
		
		Note that the energy of the return wavelet is not normalised
		according to `s`.
		
		The fundamental frequency of this wavelet in Hz is given
		by ``f = 2*s*w*r / M`` where `r` is the sampling rate.
		
		Note: This function was created before `cwt` and is not compatible
		with it.

		This function was designed to work with `cwt`. Because `morlet2`
		returns an array of complex numbers, the `dtype` argument of `cwt`
		should be set to `complex128` for best results.
		
		Note the difference in implementation with `morlet`.
		The fundamental frequency of this wavelet in Hz is given by::
		
		    f = w*fs / (2*s*np.pi)
		
		where ``fs`` is the sampling rate and `s` is the wavelet width parameter.
		Similarly we can get the wavelet width parameter at ``f``::
		
		    s = w*fs / (2*f*np.pi)
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> from scipy import signal
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		
		>>> M = 100
		>>> s = 4.0
		>>> w = 2.0
		>>> wavelet = signal.morlet2(M, s, w)
		>>> plt.plot(abs(wavelet))
		>>> plt.show()
		
		This example shows basic use of `morlet2` with `cwt` in time-frequency
		analysis:
		
		>>> from scipy import signal
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> t, dt = np.linspace(0, 1, 200, retstep=True)
		>>> fs = 1/dt
		>>> w = 6.
		>>> sig = np.cos(2*np.pi*(50 + 10*t)*t) + np.sin(40*np.pi*t)
		>>> freq = np.linspace(1, fs/2, 100)
		>>> widths = w*fs / (2*freq*np.pi)
		>>> cwtm = signal.cwt(sig, signal.morlet2, widths, w=w)
		>>> plt.pcolormesh(t, freq, np.abs(cwtm), cmap='viridis', shading='gouraud')
		>>> plt.show()

		Calculate the prominence of each peak in a signal.
		
		The prominence of a peak measures how much a peak stands out from the
		surrounding baseline of the signal and is defined as the vertical distance
		between the peak and its lowest contour line.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : sequence
		    A signal with peaks.
		peaks : sequence
		    Indices of peaks in `x`.
		wlen : int, optional
		    A window length in samples that optionally limits the evaluated area for
		    each peak to a subset of `x`. The peak is always placed in the middle of
		    the window therefore the given length is rounded up to the next odd
		    integer. This parameter can speed up the calculation (see Notes).
		
		Returns
		-------
		prominences : ndarray
		    The calculated prominences for each peak in `peaks`.
		left_bases, right_bases : ndarray
		    The peaks' bases as indices in `x` to the left and right of each peak.
		    The higher base of each pair is a peak's lowest contour line.
		
		Raises
		------
		ValueError
		    If a value in `peaks` is an invalid index for `x`.
		
		Warns
		-----
		PeakPropertyWarning
		    For indices in `peaks` that don't point to valid local maxima in `x`,
		    the returned prominence will be 0 and this warning is raised. This
		    also happens if `wlen` is smaller than the plateau size of a peak.
		
		Warnings
		--------
		This function may return unexpected results for data containing NaNs. To
		avoid this, NaNs should either be removed or replaced.
		
		See Also
		--------
		find_peaks
		    Find peaks inside a signal based on peak properties.
		peak_widths
		    Calculate the width of peaks.
		
		Notes
		-----
		Strategy to compute a peak's prominence:
		
		1. Extend a horizontal line from the current peak to the left and right
		   until the line either reaches the window border (see `wlen`) or
		   intersects the signal again at the slope of a higher peak. An
		   intersection with a peak of the same height is ignored.
		2. On each side find the minimal signal value within the interval defined
		   above. These points are the peak's bases.
		3. The higher one of the two bases marks the peak's lowest contour line. The
		   prominence can then be calculated as the vertical difference between the
		   peaks height itself and its lowest contour line.
		
		Searching for the peak's bases can be slow for large `x` with periodic
		behavior because large chunks or even the full signal need to be evaluated
		for the first algorithmic step. This evaluation area can be limited with the
		parameter `wlen` which restricts the algorithm to a window around the
		current peak and can shorten the calculation time if the window length is
		short in relation to `x`.
		However, this may stop the algorithm from finding the true global contour
		line if the peak's true bases are outside this window. Instead, a higher
		contour line is found within the restricted window leading to a smaller
		calculated prominence. In practice, this is only relevant for the highest set
		of peaks in `x`. This behavior may even be used intentionally to calculate
		"local" prominences.

		Note how the peak at index 3 of the same height is not considered as a

		Calculate the width of each peak in a signal.

		    Find peaks inside a signal based on peak properties.
		peak_prominences

		Notes
		-----
		The basic algorithm to calculate a peak's width is as follows:
		
		* Calculate the evaluation height :math:`h_{eval}` with the formula
		  :math:`h_{eval} = h_{Peak} - P \cdot R`, where :math:`h_{Peak}` is the
		  height of the peak itself, :math:`P` is the peak's prominence and
		  :math:`R` a positive ratio specified with the argument `rel_height`.
		* Draw a horizontal line at the evaluation height to both sides, starting at
		  the peak's current vertical position until the lines either intersect a
		  slope, the signal border or cross the vertical position of the peak's
		  base (see `peak_prominences` for an definition). For the first case,
		  intersection with the signal, the true intersection point is estimated
		  with linear interpolation.
		* Calculate the width as the horizontal distance between the chosen
		  endpoints on both sides. As a consequence of this the maximal possible
		  width for each peak is the horizontal distance between its bases.
		
		As shown above to calculate a peak's width its prominence and bases must be
		known. You can supply these yourself with the argument `prominence_data`.
		Otherwise, they are internally calculated (see `peak_prominences`).

		Notes
		-----
		The Tits and Yang (YT), [2]_ paper is an update of the original Kautsky et
		al. (KNV) paper [1]_.  KNV relies on rank-1 updates to find the transfer
		matrix X such that ``X * diag(poles) = (A - B*K)*X``, whereas YT uses
		rank-2 updates. This yields on average more robust solutions (see [2]_
		pp 21-22), furthermore the YT algorithm supports complex poles whereas KNV
		does not in its original version.  Only update method 0 proposed by KNV has
		been implemented here, hence the name ``'KNV0'``.
		
		KNV extended to complex poles is used in Matlab's ``place`` function, YT is
		distributed under a non-free licence by Slicot under the name ``robpole``.
		It is unclear and undocumented how KNV0 has been extended to complex poles
		(Tits and Yang claim on page 14 of their paper that their method can not be
		used to extend KNV to complex poles), therefore only YT supports them in
		this implementation.
		
		As the solution to the problem of pole placement is not unique for MIMO
		systems, both methods start with a tentative transfer matrix which is
		altered in various way to increase its determinant.  Both methods have been
		proven to converge to a stable solution, however depending on the way the
		initial transfer matrix is chosen they will converge to different
		solutions and therefore there is absolutely no guarantee that using
		``'KNV0'`` will yield results similar to Matlab's or any other
		implementation of these algorithms.
		
		Using the default method ``'YT'`` should be fine in most cases; ``'KNV0'``
		is only provided because it is needed by ``'YT'`` in some specific cases.
		Furthermore ``'YT'`` gives on average more robust results than ``'KNV0'``
		when ``abs(det(X))`` is used as a robustness indicator.

		Examples
		--------
		A simple example demonstrating real pole placement using both KNV and YT
		algorithms.  This is example number 1 from section 4 of the reference KNV
		publication ([1]_):
		
		>>> from scipy import signal
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		
		>>> A = np.array([[ 1.380,  -0.2077,  6.715, -5.676  ],
		...               [-0.5814, -4.290,   0,      0.6750 ],
		...               [ 1.067,   4.273,  -6.654,  5.893  ],
		...               [ 0.0480,  4.273,   1.343, -2.104  ]])
		>>> B = np.array([[ 0,      5.679 ],
		...               [ 1.136,  1.136 ],
		...               [ 0,      0,    ],
		...               [-3.146,  0     ]])
		>>> P = np.array([-0.2, -0.5, -5.0566, -8.6659])
		
		Now compute K with KNV method 0, with the default YT method and with the YT
		method while forcing 100 iterations of the algorithm and print some results
		after each call.
		
		>>> fsf1 = signal.place_poles(A, B, P, method='KNV0')
		>>> fsf1.gain_matrix
		array([[ 0.20071427, -0.96665799,  0.24066128, -0.10279785],
		       [ 0.50587268,  0.57779091,  0.51795763, -0.41991442]])
		
		>>> fsf2 = signal.place_poles(A, B, P)  # uses YT method
		>>> fsf2.computed_poles
		array([-8.6659, -5.0566, -0.5   , -0.2   ])
		
		>>> fsf3 = signal.place_poles(A, B, P, rtol=-1, maxiter=100)
		>>> fsf3.X
		array([[ 0.52072442+0.j, -0.08409372+0.j, -0.56847937+0.j,  0.74823657+0.j],
		       [-0.04977751+0.j, -0.80872954+0.j,  0.13566234+0.j, -0.29322906+0.j],
		       [-0.82266932+0.j, -0.19168026+0.j, -0.56348322+0.j, -0.43815060+0.j],
		       [ 0.22267347+0.j,  0.54967577+0.j, -0.58387806+0.j, -0.40271926+0.j]])
		
		The absolute value of the determinant of X is a good indicator to check the
		robustness of the results, both ``'KNV0'`` and ``'YT'`` aim at maximizing
		it.  Below a comparison of the robustness of the results above:
		
		>>> abs(np.linalg.det(fsf1.X)) < abs(np.linalg.det(fsf2.X))
		True
		>>> abs(np.linalg.det(fsf2.X)) < abs(np.linalg.det(fsf3.X))
		True
		
		Now a simple example for complex poles:
		
		>>> A = np.array([[ 0,  7/3.,  0,   0   ],
		...               [ 0,   0,    0,  7/9. ],
		...               [ 0,   0,    0,   0   ],
		...               [ 0,   0,    0,   0   ]])
		>>> B = np.array([[ 0,  0 ],
		...               [ 0,  0 ],
		...               [ 1,  0 ],
		...               [ 0,  1 ]])
		>>> P = np.array([-3, -1, -2-1j, -2+1j]) / 3.
		>>> fsf = signal.place_poles(A, B, P, method='YT')
		
		We can plot the desired and computed poles in the complex plane:
		
		>>> t = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 401)
		>>> plt.plot(np.cos(t), np.sin(t), 'k--')  # unit circle
		>>> plt.plot(fsf.requested_poles.real, fsf.requested_poles.imag,
		...          'wo', label='Desired')
		>>> plt.plot(fsf.computed_poles.real, fsf.computed_poles.imag, 'bx',
		...          label='Placed')
		>>> plt.grid()
		>>> plt.axis('image')
		>>> plt.axis([-1.1, 1.1, -1.1, 1.1])
		>>> plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc=2, numpoints=1)

		Examples
		--------
		In these examples `remez` gets used creating a bandpass, bandstop, lowpass
		and highpass filter. The used parameters are the filter order, an array
		with according frequency boundaries, the desired attenuation values and the
		sampling frequency. Using `freqz` the corresponding frequency response
		gets calculated and plotted.

		This example shows a steep low pass transition according to the small
		transition width and high filter order:
		
		>>> fs = 22050.0       # Sample rate, Hz
		>>> cutoff = 8000.0    # Desired cutoff frequency, Hz
		>>> trans_width = 100  # Width of transition from pass band to stop band, Hz
		>>> numtaps = 400      # Size of the FIR filter.
		>>> taps = signal.remez(numtaps, [0, cutoff, cutoff + trans_width, 0.5*fs], [1, 0], Hz=fs)
		>>> w, h = signal.freqz(taps, [1], worN=2000)
		>>> plot_response(fs, w, h, "Low-pass Filter")
		
		This example shows a high pass filter:
		
		>>> fs = 22050.0       # Sample rate, Hz
		>>> cutoff = 2000.0    # Desired cutoff frequency, Hz
		>>> trans_width = 250  # Width of transition from pass band to stop band, Hz
		>>> numtaps = 125      # Size of the FIR filter.
		>>> taps = signal.remez(numtaps, [0, cutoff - trans_width, cutoff, 0.5*fs],
		...                     [0, 1], Hz=fs)
		>>> w, h = signal.freqz(taps, [1], worN=2000)
		>>> plot_response(fs, w, h, "High-pass Filter")
		
		For a signal sampled with 22 kHz a bandpass filter with a pass band of 2-5
		kHz gets calculated using the Remez algorithm. The transition width is 260
		Hz and the filter order 10:
		
		>>> fs = 22000.0         # Sample rate, Hz
		>>> band = [2000, 5000]  # Desired pass band, Hz
		>>> trans_width = 260    # Width of transition from pass band to stop band, Hz
		>>> numtaps = 10        # Size of the FIR filter.
		>>> edges = [0, band[0] - trans_width, band[0], band[1],
		...          band[1] + trans_width, 0.5*fs]
		>>> taps = signal.remez(numtaps, edges, [0, 1, 0], Hz=fs)
		>>> w, h = signal.freqz(taps, [1], worN=2000)
		>>> plot_response(fs, w, h, "Band-pass Filter")
		
		It can be seen that for this bandpass filter, the low order leads to higher
		ripple and less steep transitions. There is very low attenuation in the
		stop band and little overshoot in the pass band.  Of course the desired
		gain can be better approximated with a higher filter order.
		
		The next example shows a bandstop filter. Because of the high filter order
		the transition is quite steep:
		
		>>> fs = 20000.0         # Sample rate, Hz
		>>> band = [6000, 8000]  # Desired stop band, Hz
		>>> trans_width = 200    # Width of transition from pass band to stop band, Hz
		>>> numtaps = 175        # Size of the FIR filter.
		>>> edges = [0, band[0] - trans_width, band[0], band[1], band[1] + trans_width, 0.5*fs]
		>>> taps = signal.remez(numtaps, edges, [1, 0, 1], Hz=fs)
		>>> w, h = signal.freqz(taps, [1], worN=2000)
		>>> plot_response(fs, w, h, "Band-stop Filter")
		
		>>> plt.show()

		Resample `x` to `num` samples using Fourier method along the given axis.
		
		The resampled signal starts at the same value as `x` but is sampled
		with a spacing of ``len(x) / num * (spacing of x)``.  Because a
		Fourier method is used, the signal is assumed to be periodic.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    The data to be resampled.
		num : int
		    The number of samples in the resampled signal.
		t : array_like, optional
		    If `t` is given, it is assumed to be the equally spaced sample
		    positions associated with the signal data in `x`.
		axis : int, optional
		    The axis of `x` that is resampled.  Default is 0.
		window : array_like, callable, string, float, or tuple, optional
		    Specifies the window applied to the signal in the Fourier
		    domain.  See below for details.
		domain : string, optional
		    A string indicating the domain of the input `x`:
		    ``time`` Consider the input `x` as time-domain (Default),
		    ``freq`` Consider the input `x` as frequency-domain.
		
		Returns
		-------
		resampled_x or (resampled_x, resampled_t)
		    Either the resampled array, or, if `t` was given, a tuple
		    containing the resampled array and the corresponding resampled
		    positions.
		
		See Also
		--------
		decimate : Downsample the signal after applying an FIR or IIR filter.
		resample_poly : Resample using polyphase filtering and an FIR filter.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The argument `window` controls a Fourier-domain window that tapers
		the Fourier spectrum before zero-padding to alleviate ringing in
		the resampled values for sampled signals you didn't intend to be
		interpreted as band-limited.
		
		If `window` is a function, then it is called with a vector of inputs
		indicating the frequency bins (i.e. fftfreq(x.shape[axis]) ).
		
		If `window` is an array of the same length as `x.shape[axis]` it is
		assumed to be the window to be applied directly in the Fourier
		domain (with dc and low-frequency first).
		
		For any other type of `window`, the function `scipy.signal.get_window`
		is called to generate the window.
		
		The first sample of the returned vector is the same as the first
		sample of the input vector.  The spacing between samples is changed
		from ``dx`` to ``dx * len(x) / num``.
		
		If `t` is not None, then it is used solely to calculate the resampled
		positions `resampled_t`
		
		As noted, `resample` uses FFT transformations, which can be very
		slow if the number of input or output samples is large and prime;
		see `scipy.fft.fft`.
		
		Examples
		--------
		Note that the end of the resampled data rises to meet the first
		sample of the next cycle:
		
		>>> from scipy import signal
		
		>>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 20, endpoint=False)
		>>> y = np.cos(-x**2/6.0)
		>>> f = signal.resample(y, 100)
		>>> xnew = np.linspace(0, 10, 100, endpoint=False)
		
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> plt.plot(x, y, 'go-', xnew, f, '.-', 10, y[0], 'ro')
		>>> plt.legend(['data', 'resampled'], loc='best')

	/**
		Resample `x` along the given axis using polyphase filtering.
		
		The signal `x` is upsampled by the factor `up`, a zero-phase low-pass
		FIR filter is applied, and then it is downsampled by the factor `down`.
		The resulting sample rate is ``up / down`` times the original sample
		rate. By default, values beyond the boundary of the signal are assumed
		to be zero during the filtering step.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    The data to be resampled.
		up : int
		    The upsampling factor.
		down : int
		    The downsampling factor.
		axis : int, optional
		    The axis of `x` that is resampled. Default is 0.
		window : string, tuple, or array_like, optional
		    Desired window to use to design the low-pass filter, or the FIR filter
		    coefficients to employ. See below for details.
		padtype : string, optional
		    `constant`, `line`, `mean`, `median`, `maximum`, `minimum` or any of
		    the other signal extension modes supported by `scipy.signal.upfirdn`.
		    Changes assumptions on values beyond the boundary. If `constant`,
		    assumed to be `cval` (default zero). If `line` assumed to continue a
		    linear trend defined by the first and last points. `mean`, `median`,
		    `maximum` and `minimum` work as in `np.pad` and assume that the values
		    beyond the boundary are the mean, median, maximum or minimum
		    respectively of the array along the axis.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0
		cval : float, optional
		    Value to use if `padtype='constant'`. Default is zero.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		resampled_x : array
		    The resampled array.
		
		See Also
		--------
		decimate : Downsample the signal after applying an FIR or IIR filter.
		resample : Resample up or down using the FFT method.
		
		Notes
		-----
		This polyphase method will likely be faster than the Fourier method
		in `scipy.signal.resample` when the number of samples is large and
		prime, or when the number of samples is large and `up` and `down`
		share a large greatest common denominator. The length of the FIR
		filter used will depend on ``max(up, down) // gcd(up, down)``, and
		the number of operations during polyphase filtering will depend on
		the filter length and `down` (see `scipy.signal.upfirdn` for details).
		
		The argument `window` specifies the FIR low-pass filter design.
		
		If `window` is an array_like it is assumed to be the FIR filter
		coefficients. Note that the FIR filter is applied after the upsampling
		step, so it should be designed to operate on a signal at a sampling
		frequency higher than the original by a factor of `up//gcd(up, down)`.
		This function's output will be centered with respect to this array, so it
		is best to pass a symmetric filter with an odd number of samples if, as
		is usually the case, a zero-phase filter is desired.
		
		For any other type of `window`, the functions `scipy.signal.get_window`
		and `scipy.signal.firwin` are called to generate the appropriate filter
		coefficients.
		
		The first sample of the returned vector is the same as the first
		sample of the input vector. The spacing between samples is changed
		from ``dx`` to ``dx * down / float(up)``.
		
		Examples
		--------
		By default, the end of the resampled data rises to meet the first
		sample of the next cycle for the FFT method, and gets closer to zero
		for the polyphase method:
		
		>>> from scipy import signal
		
		>>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 20, endpoint=False)
		>>> y = np.cos(-x**2/6.0)
		>>> f_fft = signal.resample(y, 100)
		>>> f_poly = signal.resample_poly(y, 100, 20)
		>>> xnew = np.linspace(0, 10, 100, endpoint=False)
		
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> plt.plot(xnew, f_fft, 'b.-', xnew, f_poly, 'r.-')
		>>> plt.plot(x, y, 'ko-')
		>>> plt.plot(10, y[0], 'bo', 10, 0., 'ro')  # boundaries
		>>> plt.legend(['resample', 'resamp_poly', 'data'], loc='best')
		>>> plt.show()
		
		This default behaviour can be changed by using the padtype option:
		
		>>> import numpy as np
		>>> from scipy import signal
		
		>>> N = 5
		>>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, N, endpoint=False)
		>>> y = 2 + x**2 - 1.7*np.sin(x) + .2*np.cos(11*x)
		>>> y2 = 1 + x**3 + 0.1*np.sin(x) + .1*np.cos(11*x)
		>>> Y = np.stack([y, y2], axis=-1)
		>>> up = 4
		>>> xr = np.linspace(0, 1, N*up, endpoint=False)
		
		>>> y2 = signal.resample_poly(Y, up, 1, padtype='constant')
		>>> y3 = signal.resample_poly(Y, up, 1, padtype='mean')

		The form of partial fraction expansion depends on poles multiplicity in
		the exact mathematical sense. However there is no way to exactly
		determine multiplicity of roots of a polynomial in numerical computing.
		Thus you should think of the result of `residue` with given `tol` as

		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    The data to be filtered. If `x` is not a single or double precision

		    before filtering.
		window_length : int

		polyorder : int

		mode : str, optional
		    Must be 'mirror', 'constant', 'nearest', 'wrap' or 'interp'. This
		    determines the type of extension to use for the padded signal to
		    which the filter is applied.  When `mode` is 'constant', the padding

		    'constant', 'wrap', and 'nearest'.
		    When the 'interp' mode is selected (the default), no extension
		    is used.  Instead, a degree `polyorder` polynomial is fit to the

		Details on the `mode` options:
		
		    'mirror':
		        Repeats the values at the edges in reverse order. The value

		    'nearest':
		        The extension contains the nearest input value.

		----------
		sos : array_like

		Parameters
		----------
		sos : array_like
		    Array of second-order filter coefficients, must have shape

		x : array_like
		    The array of data to be filtered.
		axis : int, optional
		    The axis of `x` to which the filter is applied.
		    Default is -1.
		padtype : str or None, optional
		    Must be 'odd', 'even', 'constant', or None.  This determines the
		    type of extension to use for the padded signal to which the filter
		    is applied.  If `padtype` is None, no padding is used.  The default
		    is 'odd'.
		padlen : int or None, optional
		    The number of elements by which to extend `x` at both ends of
		    `axis` before applying the filter.  This value must be less than
		    ``x.shape[axis] - 1``.  ``padlen=0`` implies no padding.
		    The default value is::
		
		        3 * (2 * len(sos) + 1 - min((sos[:, 2] == 0).sum(),
		                                    (sos[:, 5] == 0).sum()))
		
		    The extra subtraction at the end attempts to compensate for poles
		    and zeros at the origin (e.g. for odd-order filters) to yield
		    equivalent estimates of `padlen` to those of `filtfilt` for
		    second-order section filters built with `scipy.signal` functions.

		Compute the frequency response of a digital filter in SOS format.
		
		Given `sos`, an array with shape (n, 6) of second order sections of

		Compute a spectrogram with consecutive Fourier transforms.
		
		Spectrograms can be used as a way of visualizing the change of a
		nonstationary signal's frequency content over time.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Time series of measurement values
		fs : float, optional
		    Sampling frequency of the `x` time series. Defaults to 1.0.
		window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
		    Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
		    passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
		    DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
		    required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
		    directly as the window and its length must be nperseg.
		    Defaults to a Tukey window with shape parameter of 0.25.
		nperseg : int, optional
		    Length of each segment. Defaults to None, but if window is str or
		    tuple, is set to 256, and if window is array_like, is set to the
		    length of the window.
		noverlap : int, optional
		    Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
		    ``noverlap = nperseg // 8``. Defaults to `None`.
		nfft : int, optional
		    Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
		    `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
		detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
		    Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
		    string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
		    function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
		    detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
		    done. Defaults to 'constant'.
		return_onesided : bool, optional
		    If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If
		    `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for
		    complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.
		scaling : { 'density', 'spectrum' }, optional
		    Selects between computing the power spectral density ('density')
		    where `Sxx` has units of V**2/Hz and computing the power
		    spectrum ('spectrum') where `Sxx` has units of V**2, if `x`
		    is measured in V and `fs` is measured in Hz. Defaults to
		    'density'.
		axis : int, optional
		    Axis along which the spectrogram is computed; the default is over
		    the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
		mode : str, optional
		    Defines what kind of return values are expected. Options are
		    ['psd', 'complex', 'magnitude', 'angle', 'phase']. 'complex' is
		    equivalent to the output of `stft` with no padding or boundary
		    extension. 'magnitude' returns the absolute magnitude of the
		    STFT. 'angle' and 'phase' return the complex angle of the STFT,
		    with and without unwrapping, respectively.
		
		Returns
		-------
		f : ndarray
		    Array of sample frequencies.
		t : ndarray
		    Array of segment times.
		Sxx : ndarray
		    Spectrogram of x. By default, the last axis of Sxx corresponds
		    to the segment times.

		--------
		periodogram: Simple, optionally modified periodogram
		lombscargle: Lomb-Scargle periodogram for unevenly sampled data
		welch: Power spectral density by Welch's method.
		csd: Cross spectral density by Welch's method.
		
		Notes
		-----
		An appropriate amount of overlap will depend on the choice of window
		and on your requirements. In contrast to welch's method, where the
		entire data stream is averaged over, one may wish to use a smaller
		overlap (or perhaps none at all) when computing a spectrogram, to
		maintain some statistical independence between individual segments.
		It is for this reason that the default window is a Tukey window with
		1/8th of a window's length overlap at each end.

	/**
		Compute the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
		
		STFTs can be used as a way of quantifying the change of a
		nonstationary signal's frequency and phase content over time.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Time series of measurement values
		fs : float, optional
		    Sampling frequency of the `x` time series. Defaults to 1.0.
		window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
		    Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
		    passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
		    DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
		    required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
		    directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
		    to a Hann window.
		nperseg : int, optional
		    Length of each segment. Defaults to 256.
		noverlap : int, optional
		    Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
		    ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``. Defaults to `None`. When
		    specified, the COLA constraint must be met (see Notes below).
		nfft : int, optional
		    Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
		    `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
		detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
		    Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
		    string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
		    function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
		    detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
		    done. Defaults to `False`.
		return_onesided : bool, optional
		    If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If
		    `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for
		    complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.
		boundary : str or None, optional
		    Specifies whether the input signal is extended at both ends, and
		    how to generate the new values, in order to center the first
		    windowed segment on the first input point. This has the benefit
		    of enabling reconstruction of the first input point when the
		    employed window function starts at zero. Valid options are
		    ``['even', 'odd', 'constant', 'zeros', None]``. Defaults to
		    'zeros', for zero padding extension. I.e. ``[1, 2, 3, 4]`` is
		    extended to ``[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0]`` for ``nperseg=3``.
		padded : bool, optional
		    Specifies whether the input signal is zero-padded at the end to
		    make the signal fit exactly into an integer number of window
		    segments, so that all of the signal is included in the output.
		    Defaults to `True`. Padding occurs after boundary extension, if
		    `boundary` is not `None`, and `padded` is `True`, as is the
		    default.
		axis : int, optional
		    Axis along which the STFT is computed; the default is over the
		    last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
		
		Returns
		-------
		f : ndarray
		    Array of sample frequencies.
		t : ndarray
		    Array of segment times.
		Zxx : ndarray
		    STFT of `x`. By default, the last axis of `Zxx` corresponds
		    to the segment times.

		Notes
		-----
		In order to enable inversion of an STFT via the inverse STFT in
		`istft`, the signal windowing must obey the constraint of "Nonzero
		OverLap Add" (NOLA), and the input signal must have complete
		windowing coverage (i.e. ``(x.shape[axis] - nperseg) %
		(nperseg-noverlap) == 0``). The `padded` argument may be used to
		accomplish this.
		
		Given a time-domain signal :math:`x[n]`, a window :math:`w[n]`, and a hop
		size :math:`H` = `nperseg - noverlap`, the windowed frame at time index
		:math:`t` is given by
		
		.. math:: x_{t}[n]=x[n]w[n-tH]
		
		The overlap-add (OLA) reconstruction equation is given by
		
		.. math:: x[n]=\frac{\sum_{t}x_{t}[n]w[n-tH]}{\sum_{t}w^{2}[n-tH]}
		
		The NOLA constraint ensures that every normalization term that appears
		in the denomimator of the OLA reconstruction equation is nonzero. Whether a
		choice of `window`, `nperseg`, and `noverlap` satisfy this constraint can
		be tested with `check_NOLA`.

		Notes
		-----
		If some values of `b` are too close to 0, they are removed. In that case,
		a BadCoefficients warning is emitted.
		
		The `b` and `a` arrays are interpreted as coefficients for positive,
		descending powers of the transfer function variable. So the inputs
		:math:`b = [b_0, b_1, ..., b_M]` and :math:`a =[a_0, a_1, ..., a_N]`
		can represent an analog filter of the form:
		
		.. math::
		
		    H(s) = \frac
		    {b_0 s^M + b_1 s^{(M-1)} + \cdots + b_M}
		    {a_0 s^N + a_1 s^{(N-1)} + \cdots + a_N}
		
		or a discrete-time filter of the form:
		
		.. math::
		
		    H(z) = \frac
		    {b_0 z^M + b_1 z^{(M-1)} + \cdots + b_M}
		    {a_0 z^N + a_1 z^{(N-1)} + \cdots + a_N}
		
		This "positive powers" form is found more commonly in controls
		engineering. If `M` and `N` are equal (which is true for all filters
		generated by the bilinear transform), then this happens to be equivalent
		to the "negative powers" discrete-time form preferred in DSP:
		
		.. math::
		
		    H(z) = \frac
		    {b_0 + b_1 z^{-1} + \cdots + b_M z^{-M}}
		    {a_0 + a_1 z^{-1} + \cdots + a_N z^{-N}}
		
		Although this is true for common filters, remember that this is not true
		in the general case. If `M` and `N` are not equal, the discrete-time
		transfer function coefficients must first be converted to the "positive
		powers" form before finding the poles and zeros.

		Determine unique roots and their multiplicities from a list of roots.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		p : array_like
		    The list of roots.
		tol : float, optional
		    The tolerance for two roots to be considered equal in terms of
		    the distance between them. Default is 1e-3. Refer to Notes about
		    the details on roots grouping.
		rtype : {'max', 'maximum', 'min', 'minimum', 'avg', 'mean'}, optional
		    How to determine the returned root if multiple roots are within
		    `tol` of each other.
		
		      - 'max', 'maximum': pick the maximum of those roots
		      - 'min', 'minimum': pick the minimum of those roots
		      - 'avg', 'mean': take the average of those roots
		
		    When finding minimum or maximum among complex roots they are compared
		    first by the real part and then by the imaginary part.
		
		Returns
		-------
		unique : ndarray
		    The list of unique roots.
		multiplicity : ndarray
		    The multiplicity of each root.
		
		Notes
		-----
		If we have 3 roots ``a``, ``b`` and ``c``, such that ``a`` is close to
		``b`` and ``b`` is close to ``c`` (distance is less than `tol`), then it
		doesn't necessarily mean that ``a`` is close to ``c``. It means that roots
		grouping is not unique. In this function we use "greedy" grouping going
		through the roots in the order they are given in the input `p`.
		
		This utility function is not specific to roots but can be used for any
		sequence of values for which uniqueness and multiplicity has to be
		determined. For a more general routine, see `numpy.unique`.

		Determine the vector strength of the events corresponding to the given

		The vector strength is a measure of phase synchrony, how well the

		If multiple periods are used, calculate the vector strength of each.
		This is called the "resonating vector strength".
		
		Parameters
		----------
		events : 1D array_like
		    An array of time points containing the timing of the events.
		period : float or array_like
		    The period of the signal that the events should synchronize to.
		    The period is in the same units as `events`.  It can also be an array
		    of periods, in which case the outputs are arrays of the same length.
		
		Returns
		-------
		strength : float or 1D array
		    The strength of the synchronization.  1.0 is perfect synchronization
		    and 0.0 is no synchronization.  If `period` is an array, this is also
		    an array with each element containing the vector strength at the

		phase : float or array
		    The phase that the events are most strongly synchronized to in radians.
		    If `period` is an array, this is also an array with each element
		    containing the phase for the corresponding period.

	/**
		Estimate power spectral density using Welch's method.
		
		Welch's method [1]_ computes an estimate of the power spectral
		density by dividing the data into overlapping segments, computing a
		modified periodogram for each segment and averaging the
		periodograms.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Time series of measurement values
		fs : float, optional
		    Sampling frequency of the `x` time series. Defaults to 1.0.
		window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
		    Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
		    passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
		    DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
		    required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
		    directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
		    to a Hann window.
		nperseg : int, optional
		    Length of each segment. Defaults to None, but if window is str or
		    tuple, is set to 256, and if window is array_like, is set to the
		    length of the window.
		noverlap : int, optional
		    Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
		    ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``. Defaults to `None`.
		nfft : int, optional
		    Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
		    `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
		detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
		    Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
		    string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
		    function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
		    detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
		    done. Defaults to 'constant'.
		return_onesided : bool, optional
		    If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If
		    `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for
		    complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.
		scaling : { 'density', 'spectrum' }, optional
		    Selects between computing the power spectral density ('density')
		    where `Pxx` has units of V**2/Hz and computing the power
		    spectrum ('spectrum') where `Pxx` has units of V**2, if `x`
		    is measured in V and `fs` is measured in Hz. Defaults to
		    'density'
		axis : int, optional
		    Axis along which the periodogram is computed; the default is
		    over the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
		average : { 'mean', 'median' }, optional
		    Method to use when averaging periodograms. Defaults to 'mean'.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.2.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		f : ndarray
		    Array of sample frequencies.
		Pxx : ndarray
		    Power spectral density or power spectrum of x.
		
		See Also
		--------
		periodogram: Simple, optionally modified periodogram
		lombscargle: Lomb-Scargle periodogram for unevenly sampled data
		
		Notes
		-----
		An appropriate amount of overlap will depend on the choice of window
		and on your requirements. For the default Hann window an overlap of
		50% is a reasonable trade off between accurately estimating the
		signal power, while not over counting any of the data. Narrower
		windows may require a larger overlap.
		
		If `noverlap` is 0, this method is equivalent to Bartlett's method
		[2]_.

		>>> plt.ylim([0.5e-3, 1])
		>>> plt.xlabel('frequency [Hz]')
		>>> plt.ylabel('PSD [V**2/Hz]')
		>>> plt.show()
		
		If we average the last half of the spectral density, to exclude the
		peak, we can recover the noise power on the signal.
		
		>>> np.mean(Pxx_den[256:])
		0.0009924865443739191
		
		Now compute and plot the power spectrum.
		
		>>> f, Pxx_spec = signal.welch(x, fs, 'flattop', 1024, scaling='spectrum')

		The peak height in the power spectrum is an estimate of the RMS
		amplitude.
		
		>>> np.sqrt(Pxx_spec.max())
		2.0077340678640727
		
		If we now introduce a discontinuity in the signal, by increasing the
		amplitude of a small portion of the signal by 50, we can see the
		corruption of the mean average power spectral density, but using a
		median average better estimates the normal behaviour.

		Compute the DFT of `x` only for frequencies in range `fn`.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array
		    The signal to transform.
		fn : array_like
		    A length-2 sequence [`f1`, `f2`] giving the frequency range, or a
		    scalar, for which the range [0, `fn`] is assumed.
		m : int, optional
		    The number of points to evaluate.  The default is the length of `x`.
		fs : float, optional
		    The sampling frequency.  If ``fs=10`` represented 10 kHz, for example,
		    then `f1` and `f2` would also be given in kHz.
		    The default sampling frequency is 2, so `f1` and `f2` should be
		    in the range [0, 1] to keep the transform below the Nyquist
		    frequency.
		endpoint : bool, optional

		--------
		ZoomFFT : Class that creates a callable partial FFT function.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The defaults are chosen such that ``signal.zoom_fft(x, 2)`` is equivalent
		to ``fft.fft(x)`` and, if ``m > len(x)``, that ``signal.zoom_fft(x, 2, m)``
		is equivalent to ``fft.fft(x, m)``.
		
		To graph the magnitude of the resulting transform, use::
		
		    plot(linspace(f1, f2, m, endpoint=False), abs(zoom_fft(x, [f1, f2], m)))
		
		If the transform needs to be repeated, use `ZoomFFT` to construct
		a specialized transform function which can be reused without
		recomputing constants.
		
		Examples
		--------
		To plot the transform results use something like the following:
		
		>>> from scipy.signal import zoom_fft
		>>> t = np.linspace(0, 1, 1021)

		sosfilt
		
		Notes
		-----
		The algorithm used to convert ZPK to SOS format is designed to
		minimize errors due to numerical precision issues. The pairing
		algorithm attempts to minimize the peak gain of each biquadratic
		section. This is done by pairing poles with the nearest zeros, starting
		with the poles closest to the unit circle for discrete-time systems, and
		poles closest to the imaginary axis for continuous-time systems.
		
		``pairing='minimal'`` outputs may not be suitable for `sosfilt`,
		and ``analog=True`` outputs will never be suitable for `sosfilt`.
		
		*Algorithms*
		
		The steps in the ``pairing='nearest'``, ``pairing='keep_odd'``,
		and ``pairing='minimal'`` algorithms are mostly shared. The
		``'nearest'`` algorithm attempts to minimize the peak gain, while
		``'keep_odd'`` minimizes peak gain under the constraint that
		odd-order systems should retain one section as first order.
		``'minimal'`` is similar to ``'keep_odd'``, but no additional
		poles or zeros are introduced
		
		The algorithm steps are as follows:
		
		As a pre-processing step for ``pairing='nearest'``,
		``pairing='keep_odd'``, add poles or zeros to the origin as
		necessary to obtain the same number of poles and zeros for
		pairing.  If ``pairing == 'nearest'`` and there are an odd number
		of poles, add an additional pole and a zero at the origin.
		
		The following steps are then iterated over until no more poles or
		zeros remain:
		
		1. Take the (next remaining) pole (complex or real) closest to the
		   unit circle (or imaginary axis, for ``analog=True``) to
		   begin a new filter section.
		
		2. If the pole is real and there are no other remaining real poles [#]_,
		   add the closest real zero to the section and leave it as a first
		   order section. Note that after this step we are guaranteed to be
		   left with an even number of real poles, complex poles, real zeros,
		   and complex zeros for subsequent pairing iterations.
		
		3. Else:
		
		    1. If the pole is complex and the zero is the only remaining real
		       zero*, then pair the pole with the *next* closest zero
		       (guaranteed to be complex). This is necessary to ensure that
		       there will be a real zero remaining to eventually create a
		       first-order section (thus keeping the odd order).
		
		    2. Else pair the pole with the closest remaining zero (complex or
		       real).
		
		    3. Proceed to complete the second-order section by adding another
		       pole and zero to the current pole and zero in the section:
		
		        1. If the current pole and zero are both complex, add their
		           conjugates.
		
		        2. Else if the pole is complex and the zero is real, add the
		           conjugate pole and the next closest real zero.
		
		        3. Else if the pole is real and the zero is complex, add the
		           conjugate zero and the real pole closest to those zeros.
		
		        4. Else (we must have a real pole and real zero) add the next
		           real pole closest to the unit circle, and then add the real
		           zero closest to that pole.
		
		.. [#] This conditional can only be met for specific odd-order inputs
		       with the ``pairing = 'keep_odd'`` or ``'minimal'`` methods.

		Examples
		--------
		
		Design a 6th order low-pass elliptic digital filter for a system with a
		sampling rate of 8000 Hz that has a pass-band corner frequency of
		1000 Hz. The ripple in the pass-band should not exceed 0.087 dB, and
		the attenuation in the stop-band should be at least 90 dB.
		
		In the following call to `ellip`, we could use ``output='sos'``,
		but for this example, we'll use ``output='zpk'``, and then convert
		to SOS format with `zpk2sos`:
		
		>>> from scipy import signal
		>>> z, p, k = signal.ellip(6, 0.087, 90, 1000/(0.5*8000), output='zpk')
		
		Now convert to SOS format.
		
		>>> sos = signal.zpk2sos(z, p, k)
		
		The coefficients of the numerators of the sections:
		
		>>> sos[:, :3]
		array([[ 0.0014154 ,  0.00248707,  0.0014154 ],
		       [ 1.        ,  0.72965193,  1.        ],
		       [ 1.        ,  0.17594966,  1.        ]])
		
		The symmetry in the coefficients occurs because all the zeros are on the
		unit circle.
		
		The coefficients of the denominators of the sections:
		
		>>> sos[:, 3:]
		array([[ 1.        , -1.32543251,  0.46989499],
		       [ 1.        , -1.26117915,  0.6262586 ],
		       [ 1.        , -1.25707217,  0.86199667]])
		
		The next example shows the effect of the `pairing` option.  We have a
		system with three poles and three zeros, so the SOS array will have
		shape (2, 6). The means there is, in effect, an extra pole and an extra
		zero at the origin in the SOS representation.
		
		>>> z1 = np.array([-1, -0.5-0.5j, -0.5+0.5j])
		>>> p1 = np.array([0.75, 0.8+0.1j, 0.8-0.1j])
		
		With ``pairing='nearest'`` (the default), we obtain
		
		>>> signal.zpk2sos(z1, p1, 1)
		array([[ 1.  ,  1.  ,  0.5 ,  1.  , -0.75,  0.  ],
		       [ 1.  ,  1.  ,  0.  ,  1.  , -1.6 ,  0.65]])
		
		The first section has the zeros {-0.5-0.05j, -0.5+0.5j} and the poles
		{0, 0.75}, and the second section has the zeros {-1, 0} and poles
		{0.8+0.1j, 0.8-0.1j}. Note that the extra pole and zero at the origin
		have been assigned to different sections.
		
		With ``pairing='keep_odd'``, we obtain:
		
		>>> signal.zpk2sos(z1, p1, 1, pairing='keep_odd')
		array([[ 1.  ,  1.  ,  0.  ,  1.  , -0.75,  0.  ],
		       [ 1.  ,  1.  ,  0.5 ,  1.  , -1.6 ,  0.65]])
		
		The extra pole and zero at the origin are in the same section.
		The first section is, in effect, a first-order section.
		
		With ``pairing='minimal'``, the first-order section doesn't have
		the extra pole and zero at the origin:
		
		>>> signal.zpk2sos(z1, p1, 1, pairing='minimal')
		array([[ 0.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  0.  ,  1.  , -0.75],
		       [ 1.  ,  1.  ,  0.5 ,  1.  , -1.6 ,  0.65]])

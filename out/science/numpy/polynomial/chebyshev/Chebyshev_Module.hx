		Parameters
		----------
		c : 1-D ndarray

		Returns
		-------
		zs : 1-D ndarray

		Parameters
		----------
		zs : z-series
		    The z-series to differentiate.
		
		Returns

		derivative : z-series
		    The derivative
		
		Notes
		-----
		The zseries for x (ns) has been multiplied by two in order to avoid

		Divide the first z-series by the second.
		
		Divide `z1` by `z2` and return the quotient and remainder as z-series.

		Parameters
		----------
		z1, z2 : 1-D ndarray
		    The arrays must be 1-D and have the same symmetry, but this is not

		Returns
		-------
		
		(quotient, remainder) : 1-D ndarrays
		    Quotient and remainder as z-series.
		
		Notes
		-----
		This is not the same as polynomial division on account of the desired form
		of the remainder. If symmetric/anti-symmetric z-series are denoted by S/A
		then the following rules apply:
		
		S/S -> S,S
		A/A -> S,A
		
		The restriction to types of the same symmetry could be fixed but seems like

		Notes
		-----
		Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Chebyshev series

	/**
		Differentiate a Chebyshev series.
		
		Returns the Chebyshev series coefficients `c` differentiated `m` times
		along `axis`.  At each iteration the result is multiplied by `scl` (the
		scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable). The argument
		`c` is an array of coefficients from low to high degree along each
		axis, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``1*T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2``
		while [[1,2],[1,2]] represents ``1*T_0(x)*T_0(y) + 1*T_1(x)*T_0(y) +

		Parameters
		----------
		c : array_like
		    Array of Chebyshev series coefficients. If c is multidimensional

		m : int, optional
		    Number of derivatives taken, must be non-negative. (Default: 1)
		scl : scalar, optional
		    Each differentiation is multiplied by `scl`.  The end result is
		    multiplication by ``scl**m``.  This is for use in a linear change of

		axis : int, optional

		In general, the result of differentiating a C-series needs to be

		Notes
		-----
		In general, the (polynomial) division of one C-series by another

	/**
		Least squares fit of Chebyshev series to data.
		
		Return the coefficients of a Chebyshev series of degree `deg` that is the
		least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`. If `y` is
		1-D the returned coefficients will also be 1-D. If `y` is 2-D multiple
		fits are done, one for each column of `y`, and the resulting
		coefficients are stored in the corresponding columns of a 2-D return.
		The fitted polynomial(s) are in the form
		
		.. math::  p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * T_1(x) + ... + c_n * T_n(x),
		
		where `n` is `deg`.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like, shape (M,)
		    x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
		y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
		    y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
		    points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
		    passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
		deg : int or 1-D array_like
		    Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer,
		    all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the
		    fit. For NumPy versions >= 1.11.0 a list of integers specifying the
		    degrees of the terms to include may be used instead.
		rcond : float, optional
		    Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
		    this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
		    default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
		    the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
		full : bool, optional
		    Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
		    default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
		    information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
		w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
		    Weights. If not None, the weight ``w[i]`` applies to the unsquared
		    residual ``y[i] - y_hat[i]`` at ``x[i]``. Ideally the weights are
		    chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]`` all have the
		    same variance.  When using inverse-variance weighting, use
		    ``w[i] = 1/sigma(y[i])``.  The default value is None.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.5.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		coef : ndarray, shape (M,) or (M, K)
		    Chebyshev coefficients ordered from low to high. If `y` was 2-D,
		    the coefficients for the data in column k  of `y` are in column
		    `k`.
		
		[residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : list
		    These values are only returned if ``full == True``
		
		    - residuals -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
		    - rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
		    - singular_values -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
		    - rcond -- value of `rcond`.
		
		    For more details, see `numpy.linalg.lstsq`.
		
		Warns
		-----
		RankWarning
		    The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
		    deficient. The warning is only raised if ``full == False``.  The
		    warnings can be turned off by
		
		    >>> import warnings
		    >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', np.RankWarning)

		Notes
		-----
		The solution is the coefficients of the Chebyshev series `p` that
		minimizes the sum of the weighted squared errors
		
		.. math:: E = \sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,
		
		where :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by setting up
		as the (typically) overdetermined matrix equation
		
		.. math:: V(x) * c = w * y,
		
		where `V` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, `c` are the
		coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, and `y` are the
		observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
		decomposition of `V`.
		
		If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
		neglected, then a `RankWarning` will be issued. This means that the
		coefficient values may be poorly determined. Using a lower order fit
		will usually get rid of the warning.  The `rcond` parameter can also be
		set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting fit may be
		spurious and have large contributions from roundoff error.
		
		Fits using Chebyshev series are usually better conditioned than fits
		using power series, but much can depend on the distribution of the
		sample points and the smoothness of the data. If the quality of the fit
		is inadequate splines may be a good alternative.

		Notes
		-----
		Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.
		Why is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
		variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`.  Then
		:math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
		:math:`1/a`- perhaps not what one would have first thought.
		
		Also note that, in general, the result of integrating a C-series needs
		to be "reprojected" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,
		the result of this function is "unintuitive," albeit correct; see
		Examples section below.

		.. versionadded:: 1.14.0
		
		Parameters
		----------
		func : function
		    The function to be approximated. It must be a function of a single
		    variable of the form ``f(x, a, b, c...)``, where ``a, b, c...`` are
		    extra arguments passed in the `args` parameter.
		deg : int
		    Degree of the interpolating polynomial

		Returns
		-------
		coef : ndarray, shape (deg + 1,)

		Notes
		-----
		
		The Chebyshev polynomials used in the interpolation are orthogonal when
		sampled at the Chebyshev points of the first kind. If it is desired to
		constrain some of the coefficients they can simply be set to the desired
		value after the interpolation, no new interpolation or fit is needed. This
		is especially useful if it is known apriori that some of coefficients are
		zero. For instance, if the function is even then the coefficients of the
		terms of odd degree in the result can be set to zero.

		Notes
		-----
		The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion

		.. math:: c_{000}, c_{001}, c_{002},... , c_{010}, c_{011}, c_{012},...
		
		and ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``chebval3d(x, y, z, c)`` will be the
		same up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
		fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 3-D Chebyshev
		series of the same degrees and sample points.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x, y, z : array_like
		    Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes will
		    be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on whether
		    any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to 1-D
		    arrays.
		deg : list of ints
		    List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg, z_deg].
		
		Returns
		-------
		vander3d : ndarray
		    The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
		    :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg[1]+1)*(deg[2]+1)`.  The dtype will
		    be the same as the converted `x`, `y`, and `z`.

		The weight function of the Chebyshev polynomials.
		
		The weight function is :math:`1/\sqrt{1 - x^2}` and the interval of
		integration is :math:`[-1, 1]`. The Chebyshev polynomials are
		orthogonal, but not normalized, with respect to this weight function.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		   Values at which the weight function will be computed.
		
		Returns
		-------
		w : ndarray
		   The weight function at `x`.

		normalize_axis_index(axis, ndim, msg_prefix=None)
		
		Normalizes an axis index, `axis`, such that is a valid positive index into
		the shape of array with `ndim` dimensions. Raises an AxisError with an
		appropriate message if this is not possible.
		
		Used internally by all axis-checking logic.
		
		.. versionadded:: 1.13.0
		
		Parameters
		----------
		axis : int
		    The un-normalized index of the axis. Can be negative
		ndim : int
		    The number of dimensions of the array that `axis` should be normalized
		    against
		msg_prefix : str
		    A prefix to put before the message, typically the name of the argument
		
		Returns
		-------
		normalized_axis : int
		    The normalized axis index, such that `0 <= normalized_axis < ndim`
		
		Raises
		------
		AxisError
		    If the axis index is invalid, when `-ndim <= axis < ndim` is false.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> normalize_axis_index(0, ndim=3)
		0
		>>> normalize_axis_index(1, ndim=3)
		1
		>>> normalize_axis_index(-1, ndim=3)
		2
		
		>>> normalize_axis_index(3, ndim=3)
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		...
		AxisError: axis 3 is out of bounds for array of dimension 3
		>>> normalize_axis_index(-4, ndim=3, msg_prefix='axes_arg')
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		...
		AxisError: axes_arg: axis -4 is out of bounds for array of dimension 3

	/**
		Convert a polynomial to a Chebyshev series.
		
		Convert an array representing the coefficients of a polynomial (relative
		to the "standard" basis) ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an
		array of the coefficients of the equivalent Chebyshev series, ordered
		from lowest to highest degree.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		pol : array_like
		    1-D array containing the polynomial coefficients
		
		Returns
		-------
		c : ndarray
		    1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent Chebyshev
		    series.

		--------
		cheb2poly
		
		Notes
		-----
		The easy way to do conversions between polynomial basis sets
		is to use the convert method of a class instance.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> from numpy import polynomial as P
		>>> p = P.Polynomial(range(4))
		>>> p
		Polynomial([0., 1., 2., 3.], domain=[-1,  1], window=[-1,  1])
		>>> c = p.convert(kind=P.Chebyshev)
		>>> c
		Chebyshev([1.  , 3.25, 1.  , 0.75], domain=[-1.,  1.], window=[-1.,  1.])
		>>> P.chebyshev.poly2cheb(range(4))
		array([1.  , 3.25, 1.  , 0.75])

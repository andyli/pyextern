	/**
		Compute the one-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform.
		
		This function computes the one-dimensional *n*-point discrete Fourier
		Transform (DFT) with the efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
		algorithm [CT].
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array, can be complex.
		n : int, optional
		    Length of the transformed axis of the output.
		    If `n` is smaller than the length of the input, the input is cropped.
		    If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.  If `n` is not given,
		    the length of the input along the axis specified by `axis` is used.
		axis : int, optional
		    Axis over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last axis is
		    used.
		norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
		    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
		
		    Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
		    Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
		    is scaled and with what normalization factor.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.20.0
		
		        The "backward", "forward" values were added.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : complex ndarray
		    The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
		    indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.
		
		Raises
		------
		IndexError
		    If `axis` is not a valid axis of `a`.
		
		See Also
		--------
		numpy.fft : for definition of the DFT and conventions used.
		ifft : The inverse of `fft`.
		fft2 : The two-dimensional FFT.
		fftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT.
		rfftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT of real input.
		fftfreq : Frequency bins for given FFT parameters.
		
		Notes
		-----
		FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) refers to a way the discrete Fourier
		Transform (DFT) can be calculated efficiently, by using symmetries in the
		calculated terms.  The symmetry is highest when `n` is a power of 2, and
		the transform is therefore most efficient for these sizes.
		
		The DFT is defined, with the conventions used in this implementation, in
		the documentation for the `numpy.fft` module.

		Compute the 2-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform.
		
		This function computes the *n*-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform

		the last two axes of the input array, i.e., a 2-dimensional FFT.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array, can be complex
		s : sequence of ints, optional
		    Shape (length of each transformed axis) of the output
		    (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0, ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).
		    This corresponds to ``n`` for ``fft(x, n)``.
		    Along each axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
		    the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.
		    if `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified

		axes : sequence of ints, optional
		    Axes over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last two
		    axes are used.  A repeated index in `axes` means the transform over
		    that axis is performed multiple times.  A one-element sequence means
		    that a one-dimensional FFT is performed.
		norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
		    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
		
		    Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".

		Raises
		------
		ValueError
		    If `s` and `axes` have different length, or `axes` not given and
		    ``len(s) != 2``.
		IndexError
		    If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.

		rfft : Compute the one-dimensional FFT for real input.
		ihfft : The inverse of `hfft`.
		
		Notes
		-----
		`hfft`/`ihfft` are a pair analogous to `rfft`/`irfft`, but for the
		opposite case: here the signal has Hermitian symmetry in the time
		domain and is real in the frequency domain. So here it's `hfft` for
		which you must supply the length of the result if it is to be odd.
		
		* even: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 2)) == a``, within roundoff error,
		* odd: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 1)) == a``, within roundoff error.
		
		The correct interpretation of the hermitian input depends on the length of
		the original data, as given by `n`. This is because each input shape could
		correspond to either an odd or even length signal. By default, `hfft`
		assumes an even output length which puts the last entry at the Nyquist
		frequency; aliasing with its symmetric counterpart. By Hermitian symmetry,
		the value is thus treated as purely real. To avoid losing information, the
		shape of the full signal **must** be given.

		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array, can be complex.
		s : sequence of ints, optional
		    Shape (length of each axis) of the output (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0,
		    ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).  This corresponds to `n` for ``ifft(x, n)``.
		    Along each axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
		    the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.
		    if `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified
		    by `axes` is used.  See notes for issue on `ifft` zero padding.
		axes : sequence of ints, optional
		    Axes over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last two
		    axes are used.  A repeated index in `axes` means the transform over
		    that axis is performed multiple times.  A one-element sequence means
		    that a one-dimensional FFT is performed.
		norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
		    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
		
		    Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
		    Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
		    is scaled and with what normalization factor.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.20.0
		
		        The "backward", "forward" values were added.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : complex ndarray
		    The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
		    indicated by `axes`, or the last two axes if `axes` is not given.
		
		Raises
		------
		ValueError
		    If `s` and `axes` have different length, or `axes` not given and
		    ``len(s) != 2``.
		IndexError
		    If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.

		--------

		ifftn : The inverse of the *n*-dimensional FFT.
		fft : The one-dimensional FFT.

		Notes
		-----
		`ifft2` is just `ifftn` with a different default for `axes`.
		
		See `ifftn` for details and a plotting example, and `numpy.fft` for

		Zero-padding, analogously with `ifft`, is performed by appending zeros to

		Computes the inverse of `rfft`.

		In other words, ``irfft(rfft(a), len(a)) == a`` to within numerical
		accuracy. (See Notes below for why ``len(a)`` is necessary here.)
		
		The input is expected to be in the form returned by `rfft`, i.e. the
		real zero-frequency term followed by the complex positive frequency terms

		a : array_like
		    The input array.
		n : int, optional
		    Length of the transformed axis of the output.
		    For `n` output points, ``n//2+1`` input points are necessary.  If the

		irfftn : The inverse of the *n*-dimensional FFT of real input.
		
		Notes
		-----
		Returns the real valued `n`-point inverse discrete Fourier transform
		of `a`, where `a` contains the non-negative frequency terms of a
		Hermitian-symmetric sequence. `n` is the length of the result, not the
		input.
		
		If you specify an `n` such that `a` must be zero-padded or truncated, the
		extra/removed values will be added/removed at high frequencies. One can
		thus resample a series to `m` points via Fourier interpolation by:
		``a_resamp = irfft(rfft(a), m)``.
		
		The correct interpretation of the hermitian input depends on the length of
		the original data, as given by `n`. This is because each input shape could
		correspond to either an odd or even length signal. By default, `irfft`
		assumes an even output length which puts the last entry at the Nyquist
		frequency; aliasing with its symmetric counterpart. By Hermitian symmetry,
		the value is thus treated as purely real. To avoid losing information, the
		correct length of the real input **must** be given.

		>>> np.fft.irfft([1, -1j, -1])

		Notice how the last term in the input to the ordinary `ifft` is the
		complex conjugate of the second term, and the output has zero imaginary
		part everywhere.  When calling `irfft`, the negative frequencies are not
		specified, and the output array is purely real.

		Notes
		-----
		When the DFT is computed for purely real input, the output is
		Hermitian-symmetric, i.e. the negative frequency terms are just the complex
		conjugates of the corresponding positive-frequency terms, and the
		negative-frequency terms are therefore redundant.  This function does not
		compute the negative frequency terms, and the length of the transformed
		axis of the output is therefore ``n//2 + 1``.
		
		When ``A = rfft(a)`` and fs is the sampling frequency, ``A[0]`` contains
		the zero-frequency term 0*fs, which is real due to Hermitian symmetry.
		
		If `n` is even, ``A[-1]`` contains the term representing both positive
		and negative Nyquist frequency (+fs/2 and -fs/2), and must also be purely
		real. If `n` is odd, there is no term at fs/2; ``A[-1]`` contains
		the largest positive frequency (fs/2*(n-1)/n), and is complex in the
		general case.
		
		If the input `a` contains an imaginary part, it is silently discarded.

		Notice how the final element of the `fft` output is the complex conjugate
		of the second element, for real input. For `rfft`, this symmetry is
		exploited to compute only the non-negative frequency terms.

	/**
		Return the Discrete Fourier Transform sample frequencies
		(for usage with rfft, irfft).
		
		The returned float array `f` contains the frequency bin centers in cycles
		per unit of the sample spacing (with zero at the start).  For instance, if
		the sample spacing is in seconds, then the frequency unit is cycles/second.
		
		Given a window length `n` and a sample spacing `d`::
		
		  f = [0, 1, ...,     n/2-1,     n/2] / (d*n)   if n is even
		  f = [0, 1, ..., (n-1)/2-1, (n-1)/2] / (d*n)   if n is odd
		
		Unlike `fftfreq` (but like `scipy.fftpack.rfftfreq`)
		the Nyquist frequency component is considered to be positive.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		n : int
		    Window length.
		d : scalar, optional
		    Sample spacing (inverse of the sampling rate). Defaults to 1.
		
		Returns
		-------
		f : ndarray
		    Array of length ``n//2 + 1`` containing the sample frequencies.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> signal = np.array([-2, 8, 6, 4, 1, 0, 3, 5, -3, 4], dtype=float)
		>>> fourier = np.fft.rfft(signal)
		>>> n = signal.size

		>>> freq = np.fft.fftfreq(n, d=1./sample_rate)
		>>> freq

	/**
		Compute the N-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform for real input.
		
		This function computes the N-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform over
		any number of axes in an M-dimensional real array by means of the Fast
		Fourier Transform (FFT).  By default, all axes are transformed, with the
		real transform performed over the last axis, while the remaining
		transforms are complex.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array, taken to be real.
		s : sequence of ints, optional
		    Shape (length along each transformed axis) to use from the input.
		    (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0, ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).
		    The final element of `s` corresponds to `n` for ``rfft(x, n)``, while
		    for the remaining axes, it corresponds to `n` for ``fft(x, n)``.
		    Along any axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
		    the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.
		    if `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified
		    by `axes` is used.
		axes : sequence of ints, optional
		    Axes over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last ``len(s)``
		    axes are used, or all axes if `s` is also not specified.
		norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
		    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
		
		    Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
		    Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
		    is scaled and with what normalization factor.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.20.0
		
		        The "backward", "forward" values were added.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : complex ndarray
		    The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
		    indicated by `axes`, or by a combination of `s` and `a`,
		    as explained in the parameters section above.
		    The length of the last axis transformed will be ``s[-1]//2+1``,
		    while the remaining transformed axes will have lengths according to
		    `s`, or unchanged from the input.
		
		Raises
		------
		ValueError
		    If `s` and `axes` have different length.
		IndexError
		    If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.
		
		See Also
		--------
		irfftn : The inverse of `rfftn`, i.e. the inverse of the n-dimensional FFT
		     of real input.
		fft : The one-dimensional FFT, with definitions and conventions used.
		rfft : The one-dimensional FFT of real input.
		fftn : The n-dimensional FFT.
		rfft2 : The two-dimensional FFT of real input.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The transform for real input is performed over the last transformation
		axis, as by `rfft`, then the transform over the remaining axes is
		performed as by `fftn`.  The order of the output is as for `rfft` for the
		final transformation axis, and as for `fftn` for the remaining
		transformation axes.
		
		See `fft` for details, definitions and conventions used.

		--------
		>>> a = np.ones((2, 2, 2))
		>>> np.fft.rfftn(a)

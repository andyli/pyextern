		absolute(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj])
		
		Calculate the absolute value element-wise.
		
		``np.abs`` is a shorthand for this function.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Input array.
		out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
		    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
		    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
		    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
		    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
		where : array_like, optional
		    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
		    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
		    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
		    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
		    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
		    remain uninitialized.
		**kwargs
		    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
		    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.
		
		Returns
		-------
		absolute : ndarray
		    An ndarray containing the absolute value of
		    each element in `x`.  For complex input, ``a + ib``, the
		    absolute value is :math:`\sqrt{ a^2 + b^2 }`.
		    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> x = np.array([-1.2, 1.2])
		>>> np.absolute(x)
		array([ 1.2,  1.2])
		>>> np.absolute(1.2 + 1j)
		1.5620499351813308
		
		Plot the function over ``[-10, 10]``:
		
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		
		>>> x = np.linspace(start=-10, stop=10, num=101)
		>>> plt.plot(x, np.absolute(x))

		>>> plt.imshow(np.abs(xx), extent=[-10, 10, -10, 10], cmap='gray')
		>>> plt.show()
		
		The `abs` function can be used as a shorthand for ``np.absolute`` on
		ndarrays.

		add(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj])
		
		Add arguments element-wise.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x1, x2 : array_like
		    The arrays to be added.
		    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
		    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
		out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
		    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
		    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
		    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
		    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.

		**kwargs
		    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
		    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.
		
		Returns
		-------
		add : ndarray or scalar
		    The sum of `x1` and `x2`, element-wise.
		    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.
		
		Notes
		-----
		Equivalent to `x1` + `x2` in terms of array broadcasting.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> np.add(1.0, 4.0)
		5.0
		>>> x1 = np.arange(9.0).reshape((3, 3))

		Test whether all array elements along a given axis evaluate to True.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
		axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Axis or axes along which a logical AND reduction is performed.
		    The default (``axis=None``) is to perform a logical AND over all
		    the dimensions of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in
		    which case it counts from the last to the first axis.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
		
		    If this is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple
		    axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
		out : ndarray, optional
		    Alternate output array in which to place the result.
		    It must have the same shape as the expected output and its
		    type is preserved (e.g., if ``dtype(out)`` is float, the result
		    will consist of 0.0's and 1.0's). See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more
		    details.
		
		keepdims : bool, optional
		    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
		    in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
		    the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.
		
		    If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
		    passed through to the `all` method of sub-classes of
		    `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
		    sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
		    exceptions will be raised.
		
		where : array_like of bool, optional
		    Elements to include in checking for all `True` values.
		    See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.20.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		all : ndarray, bool
		    A new boolean or array is returned unless `out` is specified,
		    in which case a reference to `out` is returned.
		
		See Also
		--------
		ndarray.all : equivalent method
		
		any : Test whether any element along a given axis evaluates to True.
		
		Notes
		-----
		Not a Number (NaN), positive infinity and negative infinity

		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input data.
		axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Axis or axes along which to operate.  By default, flattened input is
		    used.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

		Notes
		-----
		NaN values are propagated, that is if at least one item is NaN, the

		(MATLAB behavior), please use nanmax.
		
		Don't use `amax` for element-wise comparison of 2 arrays; when

		Returns the indices that would sort an array.
		
		Perform an indirect sort along the given axis using the algorithm specified

		`a` that index data along the given axis in sorted order.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Array to sort.
		axis : int or None, optional
		    Axis along which to sort.  The default is -1 (the last axis). If None,
		    the flattened array is used.
		kind : {'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'}, optional
		    Sorting algorithm. The default is 'quicksort'. Note that both 'stable'
		    and 'mergesort' use timsort under the covers and, in general, the
		    actual implementation will vary with data type. The 'mergesort' option
		    is retained for backwards compatibility.
		
		    .. versionchanged:: 1.15.0.
		       The 'stable' option was added.
		order : str or list of str, optional
		    When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
		    which fields to compare first, second, etc.  A single field can
		    be specified as a string, and not all fields need be specified,
		    but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
		    they come up in the dtype, to break ties.
		
		Returns
		-------
		index_array : ndarray, int
		    Array of indices that sort `a` along the specified `axis`.
		    If `a` is one-dimensional, ``a[index_array]`` yields a sorted `a`.
		    More generally, ``np.take_along_axis(a, index_array, axis=axis)``
		    always yields the sorted `a`, irrespective of dimensionality.

		Notes
		-----
		See `sort` for notes on the different sorting algorithms.
		
		As of NumPy 1.4.0 `argsort` works with real/complex arrays containing
		nan values. The enhanced sort order is documented in `sort`.

		array(object, dtype=None, *, copy=True, order='K', subok=False, ndmin=0,
		      like=None)
		
		Create an array.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		object : array_like
		    An array, any object exposing the array interface, an object whose
		    __array__ method returns an array, or any (nested) sequence.
		    If object is a scalar, a 0-dimensional array containing object is
		    returned.
		dtype : data-type, optional
		    The desired data-type for the array.  If not given, then the type will
		    be determined as the minimum type required to hold the objects in the
		    sequence.
		copy : bool, optional
		    If true (default), then the object is copied.  Otherwise, a copy will
		    only be made if __array__ returns a copy, if obj is a nested sequence,
		    or if a copy is needed to satisfy any of the other requirements
		    (`dtype`, `order`, etc.).
		order : {'K', 'A', 'C', 'F'}, optional
		    Specify the memory layout of the array. If object is not an array, the
		    newly created array will be in C order (row major) unless 'F' is
		    specified, in which case it will be in Fortran order (column major).
		    If object is an array the following holds.
		
		    ===== ========= ===================================================
		    order  no copy                     copy=True
		    ===== ========= ===================================================
		    'K'   unchanged F & C order preserved, otherwise most similar order
		    'A'   unchanged F order if input is F and not C, otherwise C order
		    'C'   C order   C order
		    'F'   F order   F order
		    ===== ========= ===================================================
		
		    When ``copy=False`` and a copy is made for other reasons, the result is
		    the same as if ``copy=True``, with some exceptions for 'A', see the
		    Notes section. The default order is 'K'.
		subok : bool, optional
		    If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise
		    the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array (default).
		ndmin : int, optional
		    Specifies the minimum number of dimensions that the resulting
		    array should have.  Ones will be pre-pended to the shape as
		    needed to meet this requirement.
		like : array_like
		    Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
		    NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
		    the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
		    by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
		    compatible with that passed in via this argument.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.20.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray
		    An array object satisfying the specified requirements.
		
		See Also
		--------
		empty_like : Return an empty array with shape and type of input.
		ones_like : Return an array of ones with shape and type of input.
		zeros_like : Return an array of zeros with shape and type of input.
		full_like : Return a new array with shape of input filled with value.
		empty : Return a new uninitialized array.
		ones : Return a new array setting values to one.
		zeros : Return a new array setting values to zero.
		full : Return a new array of given shape filled with value.
		
		
		Notes
		-----
		When order is 'A' and `object` is an array in neither 'C' nor 'F' order,
		and a copy is forced by a change in dtype, then the order of the result is
		not necessarily 'C' as expected. This is likely a bug.

		Parameters
		----------
		a : (..., M, M) array_like

		Counts the number of non-zero values in the array ``a``.
		
		The word "non-zero" is in reference to the Python 2.x
		built-in method ``__nonzero__()`` (renamed ``__bool__()``
		in Python 3.x) of Python objects that tests an object's
		"truthfulness". For example, any number is considered
		truthful if it is nonzero, whereas any string is considered
		truthful if it is not the empty string. Thus, this function

		sub-arrays thereof) have their ``__nonzero__()`` or ``__bool__()``
		method evaluated to ``True``.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    The array for which to count non-zeros.
		axis : int or tuple, optional
		    Axis or tuple of axes along which to count non-zeros.
		    Default is None, meaning that non-zeros will be counted
		    along a flattened version of ``a``.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0
		
		keepdims : bool, optional
		    If this is set to True, the axes that are counted are left

		    the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.19.0
		
		Returns
		-------

		Returns a true division of the inputs, element-wise.
		
		Unlike 'floor division', true division adjusts the output type
		to present the best answer, regardless of input types.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x1 : array_like
		    Dividend array.
		x2 : array_like
		    Divisor array.
		    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
		    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
		out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
		    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
		    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
		    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
		    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
		where : array_like, optional
		    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
		    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
		    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
		    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
		    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
		    remain uninitialized.
		**kwargs
		    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
		    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar
		    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.
		
		Notes
		-----
		In Python, ``//`` is the floor division operator and ``/`` the
		true division operator.  The ``true_divide(x1, x2)`` function is
		equivalent to true division in Python.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> x = np.arange(5)

		- If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is an M-D array (where ``M>=2``), it is a
		  sum product over the last axis of `a` and the second-to-last axis of `b`::
		
		    dot(a, b)[i,j,k,m] = sum(a[i,j,:] * b[k,:,m])
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    First argument.
		b : array_like
		    Second argument.
		out : ndarray, optional
		    Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned
		    if it was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be
		    C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned
		    for `dot(a,b)`. This is a performance feature. Therefore, if these
		    conditions are not met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting
		    to be flexible.
		
		Returns
		-------
		output : ndarray
		    Returns the dot product of `a` and `b`.  If `a` and `b` are both
		    scalars or both 1-D arrays then a scalar is returned; otherwise
		    an array is returned.
		    If `out` is given, then it is returned.
		
		Raises
		------
		ValueError
		    If the last dimension of `a` is not the same size as
		    the second-to-last dimension of `b`.

		Neither argument is complex-conjugated:
		
		>>> np.dot([2j, 3j], [2j, 3j])

		For 2-D arrays it is the matrix product:

		This is implemented using the ``_geev`` LAPACK routines which compute
		the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general square arrays.
		
		The number `w` is an eigenvalue of `a` if there exists a vector
		`v` such that ``a @ v = w * v``. Thus, the arrays `a`, `w`, and
		`v` satisfy the equations ``a @ v[:,i] = w[i] * v[:,i]``
		for :math:`i \in \{0,...,M-1\}`.
		
		The array `v` of eigenvectors may not be of maximum rank, that is, some
		of the columns may be linearly dependent, although round-off error may
		obscure that fact. If the eigenvalues are all different, then theoretically
		the eigenvectors are linearly independent and `a` can be diagonalized by
		a similarity transformation using `v`, i.e, ``inv(v) @ a @ v`` is diagonal.
		
		For non-Hermitian normal matrices the SciPy function `scipy.linalg.schur`
		is preferred because the matrix `v` is guaranteed to be unitary, which is
		not the case when using `eig`. The Schur factorization produces an
		upper triangular matrix rather than a diagonal matrix, but for normal
		matrices only the diagonal of the upper triangular matrix is needed, the
		rest is roundoff error.
		
		Finally, it is emphasized that `v` consists of the *right* (as in
		right-hand side) eigenvectors of `a`.  A vector `y` satisfying
		``y.T @ a = z * y.T`` for some number `z` is called a *left*
		eigenvector of `a`, and, in general, the left and right eigenvectors
		of a matrix are not necessarily the (perhaps conjugate) transposes
		of each other.

		Return the current object that defines floating-point error handling.
		
		The error object contains all information that defines the error handling
		behavior in NumPy. `geterrobj` is used internally by the other
		functions that get and set error handling behavior (`geterr`, `seterr`,

		Returns
		-------
		errobj : list
		    The error object, a list containing three elements:

		    The error mask is a single integer that holds the treatment information
		    on all four floating point errors. The information for each error type
		    is contained in three bits of the integer. If we print it in base 8, we
		    can see what treatment is set for "invalid", "under", "over", and
		    "divide" (in that order). The printed string can be interpreted with

		Return the least-squares solution to a linear matrix equation.
		
		Computes the vector `x` that approximately solves the equation

		(i.e., the number of linearly independent rows of `a` can be less than,
		equal to, or greater than its number of linearly independent columns).
		If `a` is square and of full rank, then `x` (but for round-off error)

		Parameters
		----------
		a : (M, N) array_like
		    "Coefficient" matrix.
		b : {(M,), (M, K)} array_like
		    Ordinate or "dependent variable" values. If `b` is two-dimensional,

		    of `b`.
		rcond : float, optional
		    Cut-off ratio for small singular values of `a`.

		    .. versionchanged:: 1.14.0
		       If not set, a FutureWarning is given. The previous default

		Returns
		-------
		x : {(N,), (N, K)} ndarray
		    Least-squares solution. If `b` is two-dimensional,
		    the solutions are in the `K` columns of `x`.
		residuals : {(1,), (K,), (0,)} ndarray
		    Sums of squared residuals: Squared Euclidean 2-norm for each column in
		    ``b - a @ x``.
		    If the rank of `a` is < N or M <= N, this is an empty array.
		    If `b` is 1-dimensional, this is a (1,) shape array.

		>>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])

		By examining the coefficients, we see that the line should have a

		We can rewrite the line equation as ``y = Ap``, where ``A = [[x 1]]``

		einsum : Einstein summation convention.
		dot : alternative matrix product with different broadcasting rules.
		
		Notes
		-----
		
		The behavior depends on the arguments in the following way.
		
		- If both arguments are 2-D they are multiplied like conventional
		  matrices.
		- If either argument is N-D, N > 2, it is treated as a stack of
		  matrices residing in the last two indexes and broadcast accordingly.
		- If the first argument is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by
		  prepending a 1 to its dimensions. After matrix multiplication
		  the prepended 1 is removed.
		- If the second argument is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by
		  appending a 1 to its dimensions. After matrix multiplication
		  the appended 1 is removed.
		
		``matmul`` differs from ``dot`` in two important ways:
		
		- Multiplication by scalars is not allowed, use ``*`` instead.
		- Stacks of matrices are broadcast together as if the matrices
		  were elements, respecting the signature ``(n,k),(k,m)->(n,m)``:
		
		  >>> a = np.ones([9, 5, 7, 4])
		  >>> c = np.ones([9, 5, 4, 3])
		  >>> np.dot(a, c).shape
		  (9, 5, 7, 9, 5, 3)
		  >>> np.matmul(a, c).shape
		  (9, 5, 7, 3)
		  >>> # n is 7, k is 4, m is 3
		
		The matmul function implements the semantics of the ``@`` operator introduced
		in Python 3.5 following :pep:`465`.
		
		Examples
		--------
		For 2-D arrays it is the matrix product:
		
		>>> a = np.array([[1, 0],
		...               [0, 1]])
		>>> b = np.array([[4, 1],
		...               [2, 2]])
		>>> np.matmul(a, b)
		array([[4, 1],
		       [2, 2]])
		
		For 2-D mixed with 1-D, the result is the usual.
		
		>>> a = np.array([[1, 0],
		...               [0, 1]])
		>>> b = np.array([1, 2])
		>>> np.matmul(a, b)
		array([1, 2])
		>>> np.matmul(b, a)
		array([1, 2])
		
		
		Broadcasting is conventional for stacks of arrays
		
		>>> a = np.arange(2 * 2 * 4).reshape((2, 2, 4))
		>>> b = np.arange(2 * 2 * 4).reshape((2, 4, 2))
		>>> np.matmul(a,b).shape
		(2, 2, 2)
		>>> np.matmul(a, b)[0, 1, 1]
		98
		>>> sum(a[0, 1, :] * b[0 , :, 1])
		98
		
		Vector, vector returns the scalar inner product, but neither argument
		is complex-conjugated:
		
		>>> np.matmul([2j, 3j], [2j, 3j])
		(-13+0j)
		
		Scalar multiplication raises an error.
		
		>>> np.matmul([1,2], 3)
		Traceback (most recent call last):

		    .. versionadded:: 1.14
		
		Returns
		-------
		rank : (...) array_like
		    Rank of A.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The default threshold to detect rank deficiency is a test on the magnitude
		of the singular values of `A`.  By default, we identify singular values less
		than ``S.max() * max(M, N) * eps`` as indicating rank deficiency (with
		the symbols defined above). This is the algorithm MATLAB uses [1].  It also
		appears in *Numerical recipes* in the discussion of SVD solutions for linear
		least squares [2].
		
		This default threshold is designed to detect rank deficiency accounting for
		the numerical errors of the SVD computation.  Imagine that there is a column
		in `A` that is an exact (in floating point) linear combination of other
		columns in `A`. Computing the SVD on `A` will not produce a singular value
		exactly equal to 0 in general: any difference of the smallest SVD value from
		0 will be caused by numerical imprecision in the calculation of the SVD.
		Our threshold for small SVD values takes this numerical imprecision into
		account, and the default threshold will detect such numerical rank
		deficiency.  The threshold may declare a matrix `A` rank deficient even if
		the linear combination of some columns of `A` is not exactly equal to
		another column of `A` but only numerically very close to another column of
		`A`.
		
		We chose our default threshold because it is in wide use.  Other thresholds
		are possible.  For example, elsewhere in the 2007 edition of *Numerical
		recipes* there is an alternative threshold of ``S.max() *
		np.finfo(A.dtype).eps / 2. * np.sqrt(m + n + 1.)``. The authors describe
		this threshold as being based on "expected roundoff error" (p 71).
		
		The thresholds above deal with floating point roundoff error in the
		calculation of the SVD.  However, you may have more information about the
		sources of error in `A` that would make you consider other tolerance values
		to detect *effective* rank deficiency.  The most useful measure of the
		tolerance depends on the operations you intend to use on your matrix.  For
		example, if your data come from uncertain measurements with uncertainties
		greater than floating point epsilon, choosing a tolerance near that
		uncertainty may be preferable.  The tolerance may be absolute if the
		uncertainties are absolute rather than relative.

		Compute the dot product of two or more arrays in a single function call,
		while automatically selecting the fastest evaluation order.
		
		`multi_dot` chains `numpy.dot` and uses optimal parenthesization
		of the matrices [1]_ [2]_. Depending on the shapes of the matrices,
		this can speed up the multiplication a lot.
		
		If the first argument is 1-D it is treated as a row vector.
		If the last argument is 1-D it is treated as a column vector.
		The other arguments must be 2-D.
		
		Think of `multi_dot` as::
		
		    def multi_dot(arrays): return functools.reduce(np.dot, arrays)
		
		
		Parameters
		----------
		arrays : sequence of array_like
		    If the first argument is 1-D it is treated as row vector.
		    If the last argument is 1-D it is treated as column vector.
		    The other arguments must be 2-D.
		out : ndarray, optional
		    Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned
		    if it was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be
		    C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned
		    for `dot(a, b)`. This is a performance feature. Therefore, if these
		    conditions are not met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting
		    to be flexible.

		----------
		x1, x2 : array_like

		Notes
		-----
		Equivalent to `x1` * `x2` in terms of array broadcasting.

		Matrix or vector norm.
		
		This function is able to return one of eight different matrix norms,
		or one of an infinite number of vector norms (described below), depending
		on the value of the ``ord`` parameter.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Input array.  If `axis` is None, `x` must be 1-D or 2-D, unless `ord`
		    is None. If both `axis` and `ord` are None, the 2-norm of
		    ``x.ravel`` will be returned.
		ord : {non-zero int, inf, -inf, 'fro', 'nuc'}, optional
		    Order of the norm (see table under ``Notes``). inf means numpy's
		    `inf` object. The default is None.
		axis : {None, int, 2-tuple of ints}, optional.
		    If `axis` is an integer, it specifies the axis of `x` along which to
		    compute the vector norms.  If `axis` is a 2-tuple, it specifies the
		    axes that hold 2-D matrices, and the matrix norms of these matrices
		    are computed.  If `axis` is None then either a vector norm (when `x`
		    is 1-D) or a matrix norm (when `x` is 2-D) is returned. The default
		    is None.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
		
		keepdims : bool, optional
		    If this is set to True, the axes which are normed over are left in the
		    result as dimensions with size one.  With this option the result will
		    broadcast correctly against the original `x`.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		n : float or ndarray
		    Norm of the matrix or vector(s).
		
		See Also
		--------
		scipy.linalg.norm : Similar function in SciPy.
		
		Notes
		-----
		For values of ``ord < 1``, the result is, strictly speaking, not a
		mathematical 'norm', but it may still be useful for various numerical
		purposes.
		
		The following norms can be calculated:
		
		=====  ============================  ==========================
		ord    norm for matrices             norm for vectors
		=====  ============================  ==========================
		None   Frobenius norm                2-norm
		'fro'  Frobenius norm                --
		'nuc'  nuclear norm                  --
		inf    max(sum(abs(x), axis=1))      max(abs(x))
		-inf   min(sum(abs(x), axis=1))      min(abs(x))
		0      --                            sum(x != 0)
		1      max(sum(abs(x), axis=0))      as below
		-1     min(sum(abs(x), axis=0))      as below
		2      2-norm (largest sing. value)  as below
		-2     smallest singular value       as below
		other  --                            sum(abs(x)**ord)**(1./ord)
		=====  ============================  ==========================
		
		The Frobenius norm is given by [1]_:
		
		    :math:`||A||_F = [\sum_{i,j} abs(a_{i,j})^2]^{1/2}`
		
		The nuclear norm is the sum of the singular values.
		
		Both the Frobenius and nuclear norm orders are only defined for
		matrices and raise a ValueError when ``x.ndim != 2``.

		-----
		The pseudo-inverse of a matrix A, denoted :math:`A^+`, is

		It can be shown that if :math:`Q_1 \Sigma Q_2^T = A` is the singular
		value decomposition of A, then
		:math:`A^+ = Q_2 \Sigma^+ Q_1^T`, where :math:`Q_{1,2}` are
		orthogonal matrices, :math:`\Sigma` is a diagonal matrix consisting
		of A's so-called singular values, (followed, typically, by
		zeros), and then :math:`\Sigma^+` is simply the diagonal matrix

		Compute the qr factorization of a matrix.
		
		Factor the matrix `a` as *qr*, where `q` is orthonormal and `r` is
		upper-triangular.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like, shape (..., M, N)
		    An array-like object with the dimensionality of at least 2.
		mode : {'reduced', 'complete', 'r', 'raw'}, optional
		    If K = min(M, N), then
		
		    * 'reduced'  : returns q, r with dimensions

		    * 'raw'      : returns h, tau with dimensions (..., N, M), (..., K,)
		
		    The options 'reduced', 'complete, and 'raw' are new in numpy 1.8,
		    see the notes for more information. The default is 'reduced', and to
		    maintain backward compatibility with earlier versions of numpy both
		    it and the old default 'full' can be omitted. Note that array h
		    returned in 'raw' mode is transposed for calling Fortran. The
		    'economic' mode is deprecated.  The modes 'full' and 'economic' may
		    be passed using only the first letter for backwards compatibility,
		    but all others must be spelled out. See the Notes for more
		    explanation.
		
		
		Returns
		-------
		q : ndarray of float or complex, optional
		    A matrix with orthonormal columns. When mode = 'complete' the
		    result is an orthogonal/unitary matrix depending on whether or not
		    a is real/complex. The determinant may be either +/- 1 in that
		    case. In case the number of dimensions in the input array is
		    greater than 2 then a stack of the matrices with above properties
		    is returned.
		r : ndarray of float or complex, optional
		    The upper-triangular matrix or a stack of upper-triangular
		    matrices if the number of dimensions in the input array is greater
		    than 2.
		(h, tau) : ndarrays of np.double or np.cdouble, optional
		    The array h contains the Householder reflectors that generate q
		    along with r. The tau array contains scaling factors for the
		    reflectors. In the deprecated  'economic' mode only h is returned.
		
		Raises
		------
		LinAlgError
		    If factoring fails.
		
		See Also
		--------
		scipy.linalg.qr : Similar function in SciPy.
		scipy.linalg.rq : Compute RQ decomposition of a matrix.
		
		Notes
		-----
		This is an interface to the LAPACK routines ``dgeqrf``, ``zgeqrf``,
		``dorgqr``, and ``zungqr``.
		
		For more information on the qr factorization, see for example:
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_factorization
		
		Subclasses of `ndarray` are preserved except for the 'raw' mode. So if
		`a` is of type `matrix`, all the return values will be matrices too.
		
		New 'reduced', 'complete', and 'raw' options for mode were added in
		NumPy 1.8.0 and the old option 'full' was made an alias of 'reduced'.  In
		addition the options 'full' and 'economic' were deprecated.  Because
		'full' was the previous default and 'reduced' is the new default,
		backward compatibility can be maintained by letting `mode` default.
		The 'raw' option was added so that LAPACK routines that can multiply
		arrays by q using the Householder reflectors can be used. Note that in
		this case the returned arrays are of type np.double or np.cdouble and
		the h array is transposed to be FORTRAN compatible.  No routines using
		the 'raw' return are currently exposed by numpy, but some are available
		in lapack_lite and just await the necessary work.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> a = np.random.randn(9, 6)
		>>> q, r = np.linalg.qr(a)
		>>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(q, r))  # a does equal qr
		True
		>>> r2 = np.linalg.qr(a, mode='r')

		Example illustrating a common use of `qr`: solving of least squares
		problems
		
		What are the least-squares-best `m` and `y0` in ``y = y0 + mx`` for
		the following data: {(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)}. (Graph the points
		and you'll see that it should be y0 = 0, m = 1.)  The answer is provided
		by solving the over-determined matrix equation ``Ax = b``, where::
		
		  A = array([[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]])
		  x = array([[y0], [m]])
		  b = array([[1], [0], [2], [1]])
		
		If A = qr such that q is orthonormal (which is always possible via
		Gram-Schmidt), then ``x = inv(r) * (q.T) * b``.  (In numpy practice,
		however, we simply use `lstsq`.)

	/**
		Compute the sign and (natural) logarithm of the determinant of an array.
		
		If an array has a very small or very large determinant, then a call to
		`det` may overflow or underflow. This routine is more robust against such
		issues, because it computes the logarithm of the determinant rather than
		the determinant itself.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : (..., M, M) array_like
		    Input array, has to be a square 2-D array.
		
		Returns
		-------
		sign : (...) array_like
		    A number representing the sign of the determinant. For a real matrix,
		    this is 1, 0, or -1. For a complex matrix, this is a complex number
		    with absolute value 1 (i.e., it is on the unit circle), or else 0.
		logdet : (...) array_like
		    The natural log of the absolute value of the determinant.
		
		If the determinant is zero, then `sign` will be 0 and `logdet` will be
		-Inf. In all cases, the determinant is equal to ``sign * np.exp(logdet)``.

		Examples
		--------
		The determinant of a 2-D array ``[[a, b], [c, d]]`` is ``ad - bc``:

		Notes
		-----
		The various sorting algorithms are characterized by their average speed,
		worst case performance, work space size, and whether they are stable. A
		stable sort keeps items with the same key in the same relative
		order. The four algorithms implemented in NumPy have the following
		properties:
		
		=========== ======= ============= ============ ========
		   kind      speed   worst case    work space   stable
		=========== ======= ============= ============ ========
		'quicksort'    1     O(n^2)            0          no
		'heapsort'     3     O(n*log(n))       0          no
		'mergesort'    2     O(n*log(n))      ~n/2        yes
		'timsort'      2     O(n*log(n))      ~n/2        yes
		=========== ======= ============= ============ ========
		
		.. note:: The datatype determines which of 'mergesort' or 'timsort'
		   is actually used, even if 'mergesort' is specified. User selection
		   at a finer scale is not currently available.
		
		All the sort algorithms make temporary copies of the data when
		sorting along any but the last axis.  Consequently, sorting along
		the last axis is faster and uses less space than sorting along
		any other axis.
		
		The sort order for complex numbers is lexicographic. If both the real
		and imaginary parts are non-nan then the order is determined by the
		real parts except when they are equal, in which case the order is
		determined by the imaginary parts.
		
		Previous to numpy 1.4.0 sorting real and complex arrays containing nan
		values led to undefined behaviour. In numpy versions >= 1.4.0 nan
		values are sorted to the end. The extended sort order is:
		
		  * Real: [R, nan]
		  * Complex: [R + Rj, R + nanj, nan + Rj, nan + nanj]
		
		where R is a non-nan real value. Complex values with the same nan
		placements are sorted according to the non-nan part if it exists.
		Non-nan values are sorted as before.
		
		.. versionadded:: 1.12.0
		
		quicksort has been changed to `introsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort>`_.
		When sorting does not make enough progress it switches to
		`heapsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort>`_.
		This implementation makes quicksort O(n*log(n)) in the worst case.
		
		'stable' automatically chooses the best stable sorting algorithm
		for the data type being sorted.
		It, along with 'mergesort' is currently mapped to
		`timsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort>`_
		or `radix sort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort>`_
		depending on the data type.
		API forward compatibility currently limits the
		ability to select the implementation and it is hardwired for the different
		data types.
		
		.. versionadded:: 1.17.0
		
		Timsort is added for better performance on already or nearly
		sorted data. On random data timsort is almost identical to
		mergesort. It is now used for stable sort while quicksort is still the
		default sort if none is chosen. For timsort details, refer to
		`CPython listsort.txt <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Objects/listsort.txt>`_.
		'mergesort' and 'stable' are mapped to radix sort for integer data types. Radix sort is an
		O(n) sort instead of O(n log n).
		
		.. versionchanged:: 1.18.0
		
		NaT now sorts to the end of arrays for consistency with NaN.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> a = np.array([[1,4],[3,1]])
		>>> np.sort(a)                # sort along the last axis
		array([[1, 4],
		       [1, 3]])
		>>> np.sort(a, axis=None)     # sort the flattened array

		>>> np.sort(a, axis=0)        # sort along the first axis
		array([[1, 1],
		       [3, 4]])
		
		Use the `order` keyword to specify a field to use when sorting a
		structured array:
		
		>>> dtype = [('name', 'S10'), ('height', float), ('age', int)]
		>>> values = [('Arthur', 1.8, 41), ('Lancelot', 1.9, 38),
		...           ('Galahad', 1.7, 38)]
		>>> a = np.array(values, dtype=dtype)       # create a structured array

		----------
		a : array_like

		    If axis is a tuple of ints, a sum is performed on all of the axes
		    specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as
		    before.
		dtype : dtype, optional
		    The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
		    elements are summed.  The dtype of `a` is used by default unless `a`
		    has an integer dtype of less precision than the default platform
		    integer.  In that case, if `a` is signed then the platform integer
		    is used while if `a` is unsigned then an unsigned integer of the
		    same precision as the platform integer is used.
		out : ndarray, optional
		    Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
		    the same shape as the expected output, but the type of the output
		    values will be cast if necessary.
		keepdims : bool, optional
		    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
		    in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
		    the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.
		
		    If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
		    passed through to the `sum` method of sub-classes of
		    `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
		    sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any

		Returns
		-------
		sum_along_axis : ndarray
		    An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified
		    axis removed.   If `a` is a 0-d array, or if `axis` is None, a scalar
		    is returned.  If an output array is specified, a reference to

		Notes
		-----
		Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
		raised on overflow.
		
		The sum of an empty array is the neutral element 0:
		
		>>> np.sum([])
		0.0
		
		For floating point numbers the numerical precision of sum (and
		``np.add.reduce``) is in general limited by directly adding each number
		individually to the result causing rounding errors in every step.
		However, often numpy will use a  numerically better approach (partial
		pairwise summation) leading to improved precision in many use-cases.
		This improved precision is always provided when no ``axis`` is given.
		When ``axis`` is given, it will depend on which axis is summed.
		Technically, to provide the best speed possible, the improved precision
		is only used when the summation is along the fast axis in memory.
		Note that the exact precision may vary depending on other parameters.
		In contrast to NumPy, Python's ``math.fsum`` function uses a slower but
		more precise approach to summation.
		Especially when summing a large number of lower precision floating point
		numbers, such as ``float32``, numerical errors can become significant.
		In such cases it can be advisable to use `dtype="float64"` to use a higher
		precision for the output.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> np.sum([0.5, 1.5])
		2.0
		>>> np.sum([0.5, 0.7, 0.2, 1.5], dtype=np.int32)

		The decomposition is performed using LAPACK routine ``_gesdd``.
		
		SVD is usually described for the factorization of a 2D matrix :math:`A`.
		The higher-dimensional case will be discussed below. In the 2D case, SVD is
		written as :math:`A = U S V^H`, where :math:`A = a`, :math:`U= u`,
		:math:`S= \mathtt{np.diag}(s)` and :math:`V^H = vh`. The 1D array `s`
		contains the singular values of `a` and `u` and `vh` are unitary. The rows
		of `vh` are the eigenvectors of :math:`A^H A` and the columns of `u` are
		the eigenvectors of :math:`A A^H`. In both cases the corresponding
		(possibly non-zero) eigenvalues are given by ``s**2``.
		
		If `a` has more than two dimensions, then broadcasting rules apply, as
		explained in :ref:`routines.linalg-broadcasting`. This means that SVD is
		working in "stacked" mode: it iterates over all indices of the first
		``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions and for each combination SVD is applied to the
		last two indices. The matrix `a` can be reconstructed from the
		decomposition with either ``(u * s[..., None, :]) @ vh`` or
		``u @ (s[..., None] * vh)``. (The ``@`` operator can be replaced by the
		function ``np.matmul`` for python versions below 3.5.)
		
		If `a` is a ``matrix`` object (as opposed to an ``ndarray``), then so are
		all the return values.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> a = np.random.randn(9, 6) + 1j*np.random.randn(9, 6)
		>>> b = np.random.randn(2, 7, 8, 3) + 1j*np.random.randn(2, 7, 8, 3)

		>>> smat[:6, :6] = np.diag(s)

		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array.
		axis1 : int
		    First axis.
		axis2 : int
		    Second axis.
		
		Returns
		-------
		a_swapped : ndarray
		    For NumPy >= 1.10.0, if `a` is an ndarray, then a view of `a` is
		    returned; otherwise a new array is created. For earlier NumPy
		    versions a view of `a` is returned only if the order of the
		    axes is changed, otherwise the input array is returned.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> x = np.array([[1,2,3]])
		>>> np.swapaxes(x,0,1)
		array([[1],

		Compute the 'inverse' of an N-dimensional array.
		
		The result is an inverse for `a` relative to the tensordot operation
		``tensordot(a, b, ind)``, i. e., up to floating-point accuracy,
		``tensordot(tensorinv(a), a, ind)`` is the "identity" tensor for the

		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Tensor to 'invert'. Its shape must be 'square', i. e.,
		    ``prod(a.shape[:ind]) == prod(a.shape[ind:])``.
		ind : int, optional
		    Number of first indices that are involved in the inverse sum.
		    Must be a positive integer, default is 2.
		
		Returns
		-------
		b : ndarray
		    `a`'s tensordot inverse, shape ``a.shape[ind:] + a.shape[:ind]``.
		
		Raises
		------
		LinAlgError
		    If `a` is singular or not 'square' (in the above sense).

		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Coefficient tensor, of shape ``b.shape + Q``. `Q`, a tuple, equals
		    the shape of that sub-tensor of `a` consisting of the appropriate
		    number of its rightmost indices, and must be such that

		b : array_like

		Parameters
		----------
		shape : int or tuple of ints
		    Shape of the new array, e.g., ``(2, 3)`` or ``2``.
		dtype : data-type, optional
		    The desired data-type for the array, e.g., `numpy.int8`.  Default is
		    `numpy.float64`.
		order : {'C', 'F'}, optional, default: 'C'
		    Whether to store multi-dimensional data in row-major
		    (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order in
		    memory.
		like : array_like
		    Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
		    NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
		    the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
		    by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object

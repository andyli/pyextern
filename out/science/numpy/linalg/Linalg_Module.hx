	/**
		Cholesky decomposition.
		
		Return the Cholesky decomposition, `L * L.H`, of the square matrix `a`,
		where `L` is lower-triangular and .H is the conjugate transpose operator
		(which is the ordinary transpose if `a` is real-valued).  `a` must be
		Hermitian (symmetric if real-valued) and positive-definite. No
		checking is performed to verify whether `a` is Hermitian or not.
		In addition, only the lower-triangular and diagonal elements of `a`
		are used. Only `L` is actually returned.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : (..., M, M) array_like
		    Hermitian (symmetric if all elements are real), positive-definite
		    input matrix.
		
		Returns
		-------
		L : (..., M, M) array_like
		    Upper or lower-triangular Cholesky factor of `a`.  Returns a
		    matrix object if `a` is a matrix object.
		
		Raises
		------
		LinAlgError
		   If the decomposition fails, for example, if `a` is not
		   positive-definite.

		The Cholesky decomposition is often used as a fast way of solving
		
		.. math:: A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}
		
		(when `A` is both Hermitian/symmetric and positive-definite).
		
		First, we solve for :math:`\mathbf{y}` in
		
		.. math:: L \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{b},
		
		and then for :math:`\mathbf{x}` in
		
		.. math:: L.H \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> A = np.array([[1,-2j],[2j,5]])
		>>> A
		array([[ 1.+0.j, -0.-2.j],
		       [ 0.+2.j,  5.+0.j]])
		>>> L = np.linalg.cholesky(A)
		>>> L

		This is implemented using the ``_geev`` LAPACK routines which compute
		the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general square arrays.
		
		The number `w` is an eigenvalue of `a` if there exists a vector
		`v` such that ``a @ v = w * v``. Thus, the arrays `a`, `w`, and
		`v` satisfy the equations ``a @ v[:,i] = w[i] * v[:,i]``
		for :math:`i \in \{0,...,M-1\}`.
		
		The array `v` of eigenvectors may not be of maximum rank, that is, some
		of the columns may be linearly dependent, although round-off error may
		obscure that fact. If the eigenvalues are all different, then theoretically
		the eigenvectors are linearly independent and `a` can be diagonalized by
		a similarity transformation using `v`, i.e, ``inv(v) @ a @ v`` is diagonal.
		
		For non-Hermitian normal matrices the SciPy function `scipy.linalg.schur`
		is preferred because the matrix `v` is guaranteed to be unitary, which is
		not the case when using `eig`. The Schur factorization produces an
		upper triangular matrix rather than a diagonal matrix, but for normal
		matrices only the diagonal of the upper triangular matrix is needed, the
		rest is roundoff error.
		
		Finally, it is emphasized that `v` consists of the *right* (as in
		right-hand side) eigenvectors of `a`.  A vector `y` satisfying
		``y.T @ a = z * y.T`` for some number `z` is called a *left*
		eigenvector of `a`, and, in general, the left and right eigenvectors
		of a matrix are not necessarily the (perhaps conjugate) transposes
		of each other.

		Return the least-squares solution to a linear matrix equation.
		
		Computes the vector `x` that approximately solves the equation
		``a @ x = b``. The equation may be under-, well-, or over-determined
		(i.e., the number of linearly independent rows of `a` can be less than,
		equal to, or greater than its number of linearly independent columns).
		If `a` is square and of full rank, then `x` (but for round-off error)
		is the "exact" solution of the equation. Else, `x` minimizes the
		Euclidean 2-norm :math:`||b - ax||`. If there are multiple minimizing
		solutions, the one with the smallest 2-norm :math:`||x||` is returned.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : (M, N) array_like
		    "Coefficient" matrix.
		b : {(M,), (M, K)} array_like
		    Ordinate or "dependent variable" values. If `b` is two-dimensional,

		    of `b`.
		rcond : float, optional
		    Cut-off ratio for small singular values of `a`.

		-------
		x : {(N,), (N, K)} ndarray
		    Least-squares solution. If `b` is two-dimensional,

		residuals : {(1,), (K,), (0,)} ndarray
		    Sums of squared residuals: Squared Euclidean 2-norm for each column in

		    If the rank of `a` is < N or M <= N, this is an empty array.
		    If `b` is 1-dimensional, this is a (1,) shape array.

		Returns
		-------
		rank : (...) array_like
		    Rank of A.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The default threshold to detect rank deficiency is a test on the magnitude
		of the singular values of `A`.  By default, we identify singular values less
		than ``S.max() * max(M, N) * eps`` as indicating rank deficiency (with
		the symbols defined above). This is the algorithm MATLAB uses [1].  It also
		appears in *Numerical recipes* in the discussion of SVD solutions for linear
		least squares [2].
		
		This default threshold is designed to detect rank deficiency accounting for
		the numerical errors of the SVD computation.  Imagine that there is a column
		in `A` that is an exact (in floating point) linear combination of other
		columns in `A`. Computing the SVD on `A` will not produce a singular value
		exactly equal to 0 in general: any difference of the smallest SVD value from
		0 will be caused by numerical imprecision in the calculation of the SVD.
		Our threshold for small SVD values takes this numerical imprecision into
		account, and the default threshold will detect such numerical rank
		deficiency.  The threshold may declare a matrix `A` rank deficient even if
		the linear combination of some columns of `A` is not exactly equal to
		another column of `A` but only numerically very close to another column of
		`A`.
		
		We chose our default threshold because it is in wide use.  Other thresholds
		are possible.  For example, elsewhere in the 2007 edition of *Numerical
		recipes* there is an alternative threshold of ``S.max() *
		np.finfo(A.dtype).eps / 2. * np.sqrt(m + n + 1.)``. The authors describe
		this threshold as being based on "expected roundoff error" (p 71).
		
		The thresholds above deal with floating point roundoff error in the
		calculation of the SVD.  However, you may have more information about the
		sources of error in `A` that would make you consider other tolerance values
		to detect *effective* rank deficiency.  The most useful measure of the
		tolerance depends on the operations you intend to use on your matrix.  For
		example, if your data come from uncertain measurements with uncertainties
		greater than floating point epsilon, choosing a tolerance near that
		uncertainty may be preferable.  The tolerance may be absolute if the
		uncertainties are absolute rather than relative.

		Compute the dot product of two or more arrays in a single function call,

		If the first argument is 1-D it is treated as a row vector.

		    returned in 'raw' mode is transposed for calling Fortran. The
		    'economic' mode is deprecated.  The modes 'full' and 'economic' may
		    be passed using only the first letter for backwards compatibility,

		    explanation.
		
		
		Returns
		-------
		q : ndarray of float or complex, optional
		    A matrix with orthonormal columns. When mode = 'complete' the
		    result is an orthogonal/unitary matrix depending on whether or not
		    a is real/complex. The determinant may be either +/- 1 in that
		    case. In case the number of dimensions in the input array is
		    greater than 2 then a stack of the matrices with above properties
		    is returned.
		r : ndarray of float or complex, optional
		    The upper-triangular matrix or a stack of upper-triangular
		    matrices if the number of dimensions in the input array is greater
		    than 2.
		(h, tau) : ndarrays of np.double or np.cdouble, optional
		    The array h contains the Householder reflectors that generate q
		    along with r. The tau array contains scaling factors for the
		    reflectors. In the deprecated  'economic' mode only h is returned.
		
		Raises
		------
		LinAlgError
		    If factoring fails.

		Notes
		-----
		This is an interface to the LAPACK routines ``dgeqrf``, ``zgeqrf``,
		``dorgqr``, and ``zungqr``.
		
		For more information on the qr factorization, see for example:
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_factorization
		
		Subclasses of `ndarray` are preserved except for the 'raw' mode. So if
		`a` is of type `matrix`, all the return values will be matrices too.
		
		New 'reduced', 'complete', and 'raw' options for mode were added in
		NumPy 1.8.0 and the old option 'full' was made an alias of 'reduced'.  In
		addition the options 'full' and 'economic' were deprecated.  Because
		'full' was the previous default and 'reduced' is the new default,
		backward compatibility can be maintained by letting `mode` default.
		The 'raw' option was added so that LAPACK routines that can multiply
		arrays by q using the Householder reflectors can be used. Note that in
		this case the returned arrays are of type np.double or np.cdouble and
		the h array is transposed to be FORTRAN compatible.  No routines using
		the 'raw' return are currently exposed by numpy, but some are available
		in lapack_lite and just await the necessary work.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> a = np.random.randn(9, 6)
		>>> q, r = np.linalg.qr(a)
		>>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(q, r))  # a does equal qr
		True
		>>> r2 = np.linalg.qr(a, mode='r')
		>>> np.allclose(r, r2)  # mode='r' returns the same r as mode='full'
		True
		>>> a = np.random.normal(size=(3, 2, 2)) # Stack of 2 x 2 matrices as input
		>>> q, r = np.linalg.qr(a)
		>>> q.shape
		(3, 2, 2)
		>>> r.shape
		(3, 2, 2)
		>>> np.allclose(a, np.matmul(q, r))
		True
		
		Example illustrating a common use of `qr`: solving of least squares
		problems
		
		What are the least-squares-best `m` and `y0` in ``y = y0 + mx`` for
		the following data: {(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)}. (Graph the points
		and you'll see that it should be y0 = 0, m = 1.)  The answer is provided
		by solving the over-determined matrix equation ``Ax = b``, where::
		
		  A = array([[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]])
		  x = array([[y0], [m]])
		  b = array([[1], [0], [2], [1]])
		
		If A = qr such that q is orthonormal (which is always possible via
		Gram-Schmidt), then ``x = inv(r) * (q.T) * b``.  (In numpy practice,
		however, we simply use `lstsq`.)

		Parameters
		----------
		a : (..., M, M) array_like
		    Input array, has to be a square 2-D array.
		
		Returns
		-------
		sign : (...) array_like
		    A number representing the sign of the determinant. For a real matrix,
		    this is 1, 0, or -1. For a complex matrix, this is a complex number

		Singular Value Decomposition.
		
		When `a` is a 2D array, it is factorized as ``u @ np.diag(s) @ vh
		= (u * s) @ vh``, where `u` and `vh` are 2D unitary arrays and `s` is a 1D
		array of `a`'s singular values. When `a` is higher-dimensional, SVD is
		applied in stacked mode as explained below.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : (..., M, N) array_like
		    A real or complex array with ``a.ndim >= 2``.
		full_matrices : bool, optional
		    If True (default), `u` and `vh` have the shapes ``(..., M, M)`` and
		    ``(..., N, N)``, respectively.  Otherwise, the shapes are
		    ``(..., M, K)`` and ``(..., K, N)``, respectively, where
		    ``K = min(M, N)``.
		compute_uv : bool, optional
		    Whether or not to compute `u` and `vh` in addition to `s`.  True
		    by default.
		hermitian : bool, optional
		    If True, `a` is assumed to be Hermitian (symmetric if real-valued),
		    enabling a more efficient method for finding singular values.
		    Defaults to False.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.17.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		u : { (..., M, M), (..., M, K) } array
		    Unitary array(s). The first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions have the same
		    size as those of the input `a`. The size of the last two dimensions
		    depends on the value of `full_matrices`. Only returned when
		    `compute_uv` is True.
		s : (..., K) array
		    Vector(s) with the singular values, within each vector sorted in
		    descending order. The first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions have the same
		    size as those of the input `a`.
		vh : { (..., N, N), (..., K, N) } array
		    Unitary array(s). The first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions have the same
		    size as those of the input `a`. The size of the last two dimensions
		    depends on the value of `full_matrices`. Only returned when

		The decomposition is performed using LAPACK routine ``_gesdd``.
		
		SVD is usually described for the factorization of a 2D matrix :math:`A`.
		The higher-dimensional case will be discussed below. In the 2D case, SVD is
		written as :math:`A = U S V^H`, where :math:`A = a`, :math:`U= u`,
		:math:`S= \mathtt{np.diag}(s)` and :math:`V^H = vh`. The 1D array `s`
		contains the singular values of `a` and `u` and `vh` are unitary. The rows
		of `vh` are the eigenvectors of :math:`A^H A` and the columns of `u` are
		the eigenvectors of :math:`A A^H`. In both cases the corresponding
		(possibly non-zero) eigenvalues are given by ``s**2``.
		
		If `a` has more than two dimensions, then broadcasting rules apply, as
		explained in :ref:`routines.linalg-broadcasting`. This means that SVD is
		working in "stacked" mode: it iterates over all indices of the first
		``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions and for each combination SVD is applied to the
		last two indices. The matrix `a` can be reconstructed from the
		decomposition with either ``(u * s[..., None, :]) @ vh`` or
		``u @ (s[..., None] * vh)``. (The ``@`` operator can be replaced by the
		function ``np.matmul`` for python versions below 3.5.)
		
		If `a` is a ``matrix`` object (as opposed to an ``ndarray``), then so are
		all the return values.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> a = np.random.randn(9, 6) + 1j*np.random.randn(9, 6)
		>>> b = np.random.randn(2, 7, 8, 3) + 1j*np.random.randn(2, 7, 8, 3)
		
		Reconstruction based on full SVD, 2D case:
		
		>>> u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(a, full_matrices=True)
		>>> u.shape, s.shape, vh.shape
		((9, 9), (6,), (6, 6))
		>>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(u[:, :6] * s, vh))
		True
		>>> smat = np.zeros((9, 6), dtype=complex)
		>>> smat[:6, :6] = np.diag(s)
		>>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(u, np.dot(smat, vh)))
		True
		
		Reconstruction based on reduced SVD, 2D case:
		
		>>> u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(a, full_matrices=False)
		>>> u.shape, s.shape, vh.shape
		((9, 6), (6,), (6, 6))
		>>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(u * s, vh))
		True
		>>> smat = np.diag(s)
		>>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(u, np.dot(smat, vh)))

		>>> u.shape, s.shape, vh.shape
		((2, 7, 8, 8), (2, 7, 3), (2, 7, 3, 3))

		absolute(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj])
		
		Calculate the absolute value element-wise.
		
		``np.abs`` is a shorthand for this function.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Input array.
		out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
		    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
		    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
		    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
		    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
		where : array_like, optional
		    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
		    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
		    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
		    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
		    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
		    remain uninitialized.
		**kwargs
		    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
		    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.
		
		Returns
		-------
		absolute : ndarray
		    An ndarray containing the absolute value of
		    each element in `x`.  For complex input, ``a + ib``, the
		    absolute value is :math:`\sqrt{ a^2 + b^2 }`.
		    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> x = np.array([-1.2, 1.2])
		>>> np.absolute(x)
		array([ 1.2,  1.2])
		>>> np.absolute(1.2 + 1j)
		1.5620499351813308
		
		Plot the function over ``[-10, 10]``:
		
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		
		>>> x = np.linspace(start=-10, stop=10, num=101)
		>>> plt.plot(x, np.absolute(x))
		>>> plt.show()
		
		Plot the function over the complex plane:
		
		>>> xx = x + 1j * x[:, np.newaxis]
		>>> plt.imshow(np.abs(xx), extent=[-10, 10, -10, 10], cmap='gray')
		>>> plt.show()
		
		The `abs` function can be used as a shorthand for ``np.absolute`` on
		ndarrays.
		
		>>> x = np.array([-1.2, 1.2])
		>>> abs(x)
		array([1.2, 1.2])

		----------
		x1, x2 : array_like

	/**
		arange([start,] stop[, step,], dtype=None, *, like=None)
		
		Return evenly spaced values within a given interval.
		
		Values are generated within the half-open interval ``[start, stop)``
		(in other words, the interval including `start` but excluding `stop`).
		For integer arguments the function is equivalent to the Python built-in
		`range` function, but returns an ndarray rather than a list.
		
		When using a non-integer step, such as 0.1, it is often better to use
		`numpy.linspace`. See the warnings section below for more information.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		start : integer or real, optional
		    Start of interval.  The interval includes this value.  The default
		    start value is 0.
		stop : integer or real
		    End of interval.  The interval does not include this value, except
		    in some cases where `step` is not an integer and floating point
		    round-off affects the length of `out`.
		step : integer or real, optional
		    Spacing between values.  For any output `out`, this is the distance
		    between two adjacent values, ``out[i+1] - out[i]``.  The default
		    step size is 1.  If `step` is specified as a position argument,
		    `start` must also be given.
		dtype : dtype
		    The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, infer the data
		    type from the other input arguments.
		like : array_like
		    Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
		    NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
		    the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
		    by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
		    compatible with that passed in via this argument.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.20.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		arange : ndarray
		    Array of evenly spaced values.
		
		    For floating point arguments, the length of the result is
		    ``ceil((stop - start)/step)``.  Because of floating point overflow,
		    this rule may result in the last element of `out` being greater
		    than `stop`.
		
		Warnings
		--------
		The length of the output might not be numerically stable.
		
		Another stability issue is due to the internal implementation of
		`numpy.arange`.
		The actual step value used to populate the array is
		``dtype(start + step) - dtype(start)`` and not `step`. Precision loss
		can occur here, due to casting or due to using floating points when
		`start` is much larger than `step`. This can lead to unexpected
		behaviour. For example::
		
		  >>> np.arange(0, 5, 0.5, dtype=int)
		  array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
		  >>> np.arange(-3, 3, 0.5, dtype=int)
		  array([-3, -2, -1,  0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8])
		
		In such cases, the use of `numpy.linspace` should be preferred.

		array(object, dtype=None, *, copy=True, order='K', subok=False, ndmin=0,
		      like=None)
		
		Create an array.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		object : array_like
		    An array, any object exposing the array interface, an object whose
		    __array__ method returns an array, or any (nested) sequence.
		    If object is a scalar, a 0-dimensional array containing object is
		    returned.
		dtype : data-type, optional
		    The desired data-type for the array.  If not given, then the type will
		    be determined as the minimum type required to hold the objects in the
		    sequence.
		copy : bool, optional
		    If true (default), then the object is copied.  Otherwise, a copy will
		    only be made if __array__ returns a copy, if obj is a nested sequence,
		    or if a copy is needed to satisfy any of the other requirements
		    (`dtype`, `order`, etc.).
		order : {'K', 'A', 'C', 'F'}, optional
		    Specify the memory layout of the array. If object is not an array, the
		    newly created array will be in C order (row major) unless 'F' is
		    specified, in which case it will be in Fortran order (column major).
		    If object is an array the following holds.
		
		    ===== ========= ===================================================
		    order  no copy                     copy=True
		    ===== ========= ===================================================
		    'K'   unchanged F & C order preserved, otherwise most similar order
		    'A'   unchanged F order if input is F and not C, otherwise C order
		    'C'   C order   C order
		    'F'   F order   F order
		    ===== ========= ===================================================
		
		    When ``copy=False`` and a copy is made for other reasons, the result is
		    the same as if ``copy=True``, with some exceptions for 'A', see the
		    Notes section. The default order is 'K'.
		subok : bool, optional
		    If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise
		    the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array (default).
		ndmin : int, optional
		    Specifies the minimum number of dimensions that the resulting
		    array should have.  Ones will be pre-pended to the shape as
		    needed to meet this requirement.
		like : array_like
		    Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
		    NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
		    the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
		    by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
		    compatible with that passed in via this argument.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.20.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray
		    An array object satisfying the specified requirements.
		
		See Also
		--------
		empty_like : Return an empty array with shape and type of input.
		ones_like : Return an array of ones with shape and type of input.
		zeros_like : Return an array of zeros with shape and type of input.
		full_like : Return a new array with shape of input filled with value.
		empty : Return a new uninitialized array.
		ones : Return a new array setting values to one.
		zeros : Return a new array setting values to zero.
		full : Return a new array of given shape filled with value.
		
		
		Notes
		-----
		When order is 'A' and `object` is an array in neither 'C' nor 'F' order,
		and a copy is forced by a change in dtype, then the order of the result is
		not necessarily 'C' as expected. This is likely a bug.

		--------
		The number 13 is represented by ``00001101``. Likewise, 17 is
		represented by ``00010001``.  The bit-wise XOR of 13 and 17 is
		therefore ``00011100``, or 28:
		
		>>> np.bitwise_xor(13, 17)
		28
		>>> np.binary_repr(28)
		'11100'

		true_divide(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj])
		
		Returns a true division of the inputs, element-wise.
		
		Unlike 'floor division', true division adjusts the output type
		to present the best answer, regardless of input types.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x1 : array_like
		    Dividend array.
		x2 : array_like
		    Divisor array.
		    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common

		out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
		    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
		    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
		    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a

		where : array_like, optional
		    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the

		    remain uninitialized.
		**kwargs
		    For other keyword-only arguments, see the

		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar
		    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.
		
		Notes
		-----
		In Python, ``//`` is the floor division operator and ``/`` the
		true division operator.  The ``true_divide(x1, x2)`` function is
		equivalent to true division in Python.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> x = np.arange(5)

		----------
		x : array_like

		Examples
		--------
		We've seen that 13 is represented by ``00001101``.
		The invert or bit-wise NOT of 13 is then:
		
		>>> x = np.invert(np.array(13, dtype=np.uint8))
		>>> x
		242
		>>> np.binary_repr(x, width=8)
		'11110010'
		
		The result depends on the bit-width:
		
		>>> x = np.invert(np.array(13, dtype=np.uint16))
		>>> x
		65522
		>>> np.binary_repr(x, width=16)
		'1111111111110010'
		
		When using signed integer types the result is the two's complement of
		the result for the unsigned type:
		
		>>> np.invert(np.array([13], dtype=np.int8))
		array([-14], dtype=int8)
		>>> np.binary_repr(-14, width=8)
		'11110010'
		
		Booleans are accepted as well:
		
		>>> np.invert(np.array([True, False]))
		array([False,  True])
		
		The ``~`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.invert`` on
		ndarrays.

		Bits are shifted to the left by appending `x2` 0s at the right of `x1`.

		power(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj])
		
		First array elements raised to powers from second array, element-wise.
		
		Raise each base in `x1` to the positionally-corresponding power in
		`x2`.  `x1` and `x2` must be broadcastable to the same shape.
		
		An integer type raised to a negative integer power will raise a

		Parameters
		----------
		x1 : array_like
		    The bases.
		x2 : array_like

		out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
		    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
		    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
		    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a

		where : array_like, optional
		    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the

	/**
		Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Array to be reshaped.
		newshape : int or tuple of ints
		    The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
		    an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
		    One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
		    inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
		order : {'C', 'F', 'A'}, optional
		    Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
		    elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
		    means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
		    with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
		    axis index changing slowest. 'F' means to read / write the
		    elements using Fortran-like index order, with the first index
		    changing fastest, and the last index changing slowest. Note that
		    the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of the memory layout of
		    the underlying array, and only refer to the order of indexing.
		    'A' means to read / write the elements in Fortran-like index
		    order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory, C-like order
		    otherwise.
		
		Returns
		-------
		reshaped_array : ndarray
		    This will be a new view object if possible; otherwise, it will
		    be a copy.  Note there is no guarantee of the *memory layout* (C- or
		    Fortran- contiguous) of the returned array.
		
		See Also
		--------
		ndarray.reshape : Equivalent method.
		
		Notes
		-----
		It is not always possible to change the shape of an array without
		copying the data. If you want an error to be raised when the data is copied,
		you should assign the new shape to the shape attribute of the array::
		
		 >>> a = np.zeros((10, 2))
		
		 # A transpose makes the array non-contiguous
		 >>> b = a.T
		
		 # Taking a view makes it possible to modify the shape without modifying
		 # the initial object.
		 >>> c = b.view()
		 >>> c.shape = (20)
		 Traceback (most recent call last):
		    ...
		 AttributeError: Incompatible shape for in-place modification. Use
		 `.reshape()` to make a copy with the desired shape.
		
		The `order` keyword gives the index ordering both for *fetching* the values
		from `a`, and then *placing* the values into the output array.
		For example, let's say you have an array:
		
		>>> a = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
		>>> a
		array([[0, 1],
		       [2, 3],
		       [4, 5]])
		
		You can think of reshaping as first raveling the array (using the given
		index order), then inserting the elements from the raveled array into the
		new array using the same kind of index ordering as was used for the
		raveling.
		
		>>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3)) # C-like index ordering
		array([[0, 1, 2],
		       [3, 4, 5]])
		>>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a), (2, 3)) # equivalent to C ravel then C reshape

		Notes
		-----
		The sine is one of the fundamental functions of trigonometry (the
		mathematical study of triangles).  Consider a circle of radius 1
		centered on the origin.  A ray comes in from the :math:`+x` axis, makes
		an angle at the origin (measured counter-clockwise from that axis), and
		departs from the origin.  The :math:`y` coordinate of the outgoing
		ray's intersection with the unit circle is the sine of that angle.  It
		ranges from -1 for :math:`x=3\pi / 2` to +1 for :math:`\pi / 2.`  The
		function has zeroes where the angle is a multiple of :math:`\pi`.
		Sines of angles between :math:`\pi` and :math:`2\pi` are negative.
		The numerous properties of the sine and related functions are included
		in any standard trigonometry text.
		
		Examples
		--------
		Print sine of one angle:
		
		>>> np.sin(np.pi/2.)
		1.0

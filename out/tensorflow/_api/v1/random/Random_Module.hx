	/**
		Draws `shape` samples from each of the given Gamma distribution(s).
		
		`alpha` is the shape parameter describing the distribution(s), and `beta` is
		the inverse scale parameter(s).
		
		Note: Because internal calculations are done using `float64` and casting has
		`floor` semantics, we must manually map zero outcomes to the smallest
		possible positive floating-point value, i.e., `np.finfo(dtype).tiny`.  This
		means that `np.finfo(dtype).tiny` occurs more frequently than it otherwise
		should.  This bias can only happen for small values of `alpha`, i.e.,
		`alpha << 1` or large values of `beta`, i.e., `beta >> 1`.
		
		The samples are differentiable w.r.t. alpha and beta.
		The derivatives are computed using the approach described in the paper
		
		[Michael Figurnov, Shakir Mohamed, Andriy Mnih.
		Implicit Reparameterization Gradients, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08498)
		
		Example:
		
		```python
		samples = tf.random_gamma([10], [0.5, 1.5])
		# samples has shape [10, 2], where each slice [:, 0] and [:, 1] represents
		# the samples drawn from each distribution
		
		samples = tf.random_gamma([7, 5], [0.5, 1.5])
		# samples has shape [7, 5, 2], where each slice [:, :, 0] and [:, :, 1]
		# represents the 7x5 samples drawn from each of the two distributions
		
		alpha = tf.constant([[1.],[3.],[5.]])
		beta = tf.constant([[3., 4.]])
		samples = tf.random_gamma([30], alpha=alpha, beta=beta)
		# samples has shape [30, 3, 2], with 30 samples each of 3x2 distributions.
		
		loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(samples))
		dloss_dalpha, dloss_dbeta = tf.gradients(loss, [alpha, beta])
		# unbiased stochastic derivatives of the loss function
		alpha.shape == dloss_dalpha.shape  # True
		beta.shape == dloss_dbeta.shape  # True
		```

		  shape: A 1-D integer Tensor or Python array. The shape of the output samples
		    to be drawn per alpha/beta-parameterized distribution.
		  alpha: A Tensor or Python value or N-D array of type `dtype`. `alpha`
		    provides the shape parameter(s) describing the gamma distribution(s) to
		    sample. Must be broadcastable with `beta`.
		  beta: A Tensor or Python value or N-D array of type `dtype`. Defaults to 1.
		    `beta` provides the inverse scale parameter(s) of the gamma
		    distribution(s) to sample. Must be broadcastable with `alpha`.
		  dtype: The type of alpha, beta, and the output: `float16`, `float32`, or
		    `float64`.
		  seed: A Python integer. Used to create a random seed for the distributions.
		    See
		    `tf.set_random_seed`
		    for behavior.
		  name: Optional name for the operation.
		
		Returns:
		  samples: a `Tensor` of shape
		    `tf.concat([shape, tf.shape(alpha + beta)], axis=0)` with values of type
		    `dtype`.

		Samples a set of classes using a log-uniform (Zipfian) base distribution.
		
		This operation randomly samples a tensor of sampled classes
		(`sampled_candidates`) from the range of integers `[0, range_max)`.
		
		The elements of `sampled_candidates` are drawn without replacement
		(if `unique=True`) or with replacement (if `unique=False`) from
		the base distribution.
		
		The base distribution for this operation is an approximately log-uniform
		or Zipfian distribution:
		
		`P(class) = (log(class + 2) - log(class + 1)) / log(range_max + 1)`
		
		This sampler is useful when the target classes approximately follow such
		a distribution - for example, if the classes represent words in a lexicon
		sorted in decreasing order of frequency. If your classes are not ordered by
		decreasing frequency, do not use this op.
		
		In addition, this operation returns tensors `true_expected_count`
		and `sampled_expected_count` representing the number of times each
		of the target classes (`true_classes`) and the sampled
		classes (`sampled_candidates`) is expected to occur in an average
		tensor of sampled classes.  These values correspond to `Q(y|x)`
		defined in [this
		document](http://www.tensorflow.org/extras/candidate_sampling.pdf).
		If `unique=True`, then these are post-rejection probabilities and we
		compute them approximately.

		  true_classes: A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[batch_size,

		Sets the graph-level random seed.
		
		Operations that rely on a random seed actually derive it from two seeds:
		the graph-level and operation-level seeds. This sets the graph-level seed.
		
		Its interactions with operation-level seeds is as follows:
		
		  1. If neither the graph-level nor the operation seed is set:
		    A random seed is used for this op.
		  2. If the graph-level seed is set, but the operation seed is not:
		    The system deterministically picks an operation seed in conjunction
		    with the graph-level seed so that it gets a unique random sequence.
		  3. If the graph-level seed is not set, but the operation seed is set:
		    A default graph-level seed and the specified operation seed are used to
		    determine the random sequence.
		  4. If both the graph-level and the operation seed are set:
		    Both seeds are used in conjunction to determine the random sequence.
		
		To illustrate the user-visible effects, consider these examples:
		
		To generate different sequences across sessions, set neither
		graph-level nor op-level seeds:
		
		```python
		a = tf.random_uniform([1])
		b = tf.random_normal([1])
		
		print("Session 1")
		with tf.Session() as sess1:
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A1'
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A2'
		  print(sess1.run(b))  # generates 'B1'
		  print(sess1.run(b))  # generates 'B2'
		
		print("Session 2")
		with tf.Session() as sess2:
		  print(sess2.run(a))  # generates 'A3'
		  print(sess2.run(a))  # generates 'A4'
		  print(sess2.run(b))  # generates 'B3'
		  print(sess2.run(b))  # generates 'B4'
		```
		
		To generate the same repeatable sequence for an op across sessions, set the
		seed for the op:
		
		```python
		a = tf.random_uniform([1], seed=1)
		b = tf.random_normal([1])
		
		# Repeatedly running this block with the same graph will generate the same
		# sequence of values for 'a', but different sequences of values for 'b'.
		print("Session 1")
		with tf.Session() as sess1:
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A1'
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A2'
		  print(sess1.run(b))  # generates 'B1'
		  print(sess1.run(b))  # generates 'B2'
		
		print("Session 2")
		with tf.Session() as sess2:
		  print(sess2.run(a))  # generates 'A1'
		  print(sess2.run(a))  # generates 'A2'
		  print(sess2.run(b))  # generates 'B3'
		  print(sess2.run(b))  # generates 'B4'
		```
		
		To make the random sequences generated by all ops be repeatable across
		sessions, set a graph-level seed:
		
		```python
		tf.set_random_seed(1234)
		a = tf.random_uniform([1])
		b = tf.random_normal([1])
		
		# Repeatedly running this block with the same graph will generate the same
		# sequences of 'a' and 'b'.
		print("Session 1")
		with tf.Session() as sess1:
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A1'

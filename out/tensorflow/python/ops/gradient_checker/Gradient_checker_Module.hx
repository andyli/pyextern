	/**
		Computes and returns the theoretical and numerical Jacobian.
		
		If `x` or `y` is complex, the Jacobian will still be real but the
		corresponding Jacobian dimension(s) will be twice as large.  This is required
		even if both input and output is complex since TensorFlow graphs are not
		necessarily holomorphic, and may have gradients not expressible as complex
		numbers.  For example, if `x` is complex with shape `[m]` and `y` is complex
		with shape `[n]`, each Jacobian `J` will have shape `[m * 2, n * 2]` with
		
		    J[::2, ::2] = d(Re y)/d(Re x)
		    J[::2, 1::2] = d(Im y)/d(Re x)
		    J[1::2, ::2] = d(Re y)/d(Im x)
		    J[1::2, 1::2] = d(Im y)/d(Im x)
		
		Args:
		  x: a tensor or list of tensors
		  x_shape: the dimensions of x as a tuple or an array of ints. If x is a list,
		  then this is the list of shapes.
		  y: a tensor
		  y_shape: the dimensions of y as a tuple or an array of ints.
		  x_init_value: (optional) a numpy array of the same shape as "x"
		    representing the initial value of x. If x is a list, this should be a list
		    of numpy arrays.  If this is none, the function will pick a random tensor
		    as the initial value.
		  delta: (optional) the amount of perturbation.
		  init_targets: list of targets to run to initialize model params.
		    TODO(mrry): remove this argument.
		  extra_feed_dict: dict that allows fixing specified tensor values
		    during the Jacobian calculation.
		
		Returns:
		  Two 2-d numpy arrays representing the theoretical and numerical
		  Jacobian for dy/dx. Each has "x_size" rows and "y_size" columns
		  where "x_size" is the number of elements in x and "y_size" is the
		  number of elements in y. If x is a list, returns a list of two numpy arrays.

		Computes the gradient error.
		
		Computes the maximum error for dy/dx between the computed Jacobian and the

		This function will modify the tensors passed in as it adds more operations
		and hence changing the consumers of the operations of the input tensors.
		
		This function adds operations to the current session. To compute the error
		using a particular device, such as a GPU, use the standard methods for
		setting a device (e.g. using with sess.graph.device() or setting a device
		function in the session constructor).

		Returns:
		  The maximum error in between the two Jacobians.

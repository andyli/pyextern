		`Input()` is used to instantiate a Keras tensor.
		
		A Keras tensor is a tensor object from the underlying backend
		(Theano or TensorFlow), which we augment with certain
		attributes that allow us to build a Keras model
		just by knowing the inputs and outputs of the model.
		
		For instance, if a, b and c are Keras tensors,
		it becomes possible to do:
		`model = Model(input=[a, b], output=c)`
		
		The added Keras attribute is:
		    `_keras_history`: Last layer applied to the tensor.
		        the entire layer graph is retrievable from that layer,
		        recursively.
		
		Arguments:
		    shape: A shape tuple (integers), not including the batch size.
		        For instance, `shape=(32,)` indicates that the expected input
		        will be batches of 32-dimensional vectors.
		    batch_size: optional static batch size (integer).
		    name: An optional name string for the layer.
		        Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice).
		        It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided.
		    dtype: The data type expected by the input, as a string
		        (`float32`, `float64`, `int32`...)
		    sparse: A boolean specifying whether the placeholder
		        to be created is sparse.
		    tensor: Optional existing tensor to wrap into the `Input` layer.
		        If set, the layer will not create a placeholder tensor.
		    **kwargs: deprecated arguments support.
		
		Returns:
		    A tensor.
		
		Example:
		
		    ```python
		    # this is a logistic regression in Keras
		    x = Input(shape=(32,))
		    y = Dense(16, activation='softmax')(x)
		    model = Model(x, y)
		    ```
		
		    Note that even if eager execution is enabled,
		    `Input` produces a symbolic tensor (i.e. a placeholder).
		    This symbolic tensor can be used with other
		    TensorFlow ops, as such:
		
		    ```python
		    x = Input(shape=(32,))
		    y = tf.square(x)
		    ```
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: in case of invalid arguments.

		Substitute for model cloning that works for subclassed models.
		
		Subclassed models cannot be cloned because their topology is not serializable.

		After calling this function on a model instance, you can use the model
		instance as if it were a model clone (in particular you can use it in a new
		graph).
		
		This method clears the state of the input model. It is thus destructive.

		def my_func(arg):

		Sets the graph-level random seed.
		
		Operations that rely on a random seed actually derive it from two seeds:
		the graph-level and operation-level seeds. This sets the graph-level seed.
		
		Its interactions with operation-level seeds is as follows:
		
		  1. If neither the graph-level nor the operation seed is set:
		    A random seed is used for this op.
		  2. If the graph-level seed is set, but the operation seed is not:
		    The system deterministically picks an operation seed in conjunction
		    with the graph-level seed so that it gets a unique random sequence.
		  3. If the graph-level seed is not set, but the operation seed is set:
		    A default graph-level seed and the specified operation seed are used to
		    determine the random sequence.
		  4. If both the graph-level and the operation seed are set:
		    Both seeds are used in conjunction to determine the random sequence.
		
		To illustrate the user-visible effects, consider these examples:
		
		To generate different sequences across sessions, set neither
		graph-level nor op-level seeds:
		
		```python
		a = tf.random_uniform([1])
		b = tf.random_normal([1])
		
		print("Session 1")
		with tf.Session() as sess1:
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A1'
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A2'
		  print(sess1.run(b))  # generates 'B1'
		  print(sess1.run(b))  # generates 'B2'
		
		print("Session 2")
		with tf.Session() as sess2:
		  print(sess2.run(a))  # generates 'A3'
		  print(sess2.run(a))  # generates 'A4'
		  print(sess2.run(b))  # generates 'B3'
		  print(sess2.run(b))  # generates 'B4'
		```
		
		To generate the same repeatable sequence for an op across sessions, set the
		seed for the op:
		
		```python
		a = tf.random_uniform([1], seed=1)
		b = tf.random_normal([1])
		
		# Repeatedly running this block with the same graph will generate the same
		# sequence of values for 'a', but different sequences of values for 'b'.
		print("Session 1")
		with tf.Session() as sess1:
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A1'
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A2'

		To make the random sequences generated by all ops be repeatable across
		sessions, set a graph-level seed:
		
		```python
		tf.random.set_random_seed(1234)
		a = tf.random_uniform([1])
		b = tf.random_normal([1])
		
		# Repeatedly running this block with the same graph will generate the same
		# sequences of 'a' and 'b'.
		print("Session 1")
		with tf.Session() as sess1:
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A1'
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A2'
		  print(sess1.run(b))  # generates 'B1'
		  print(sess1.run(b))  # generates 'B2'
		
		print("Session 2")
		with tf.Session() as sess2:
		  print(sess2.run(a))  # generates 'A1'
		  print(sess2.run(a))  # generates 'A2'
		  print(sess2.run(b))  # generates 'B1'
		  print(sess2.run(b))  # generates 'B2'
		```
		
		Args:
		  seed: integer.

		Return a slot named `name` created for `var` by the Optimizer.
		
		Some `Optimizer` subclasses use additional variables.  For example
		`Momentum` and `Adagrad` use variables to accumulate updates.  This method
		gives access to these `Variable` objects if for some reason you need them.
		
		Use `get_slot_names()` to get the list of slot names created by the
		`Optimizer`.
		
		Args:
		  var: A variable passed to `minimize()` or `apply_gradients()`.
		  name: A string.
		
		Returns:
		  The `Variable` for the slot if it was created, `None` otherwise.

	/**
		Add operations to minimize `loss` by updating `var_list`.
		
		This method simply combines calls `compute_gradients()` and
		`apply_gradients()`. If you want to process the gradient before applying
		them call `compute_gradients()` and `apply_gradients()` explicitly instead
		of using this function.
		
		Args:
		  loss: A `Tensor` containing the value to minimize.
		  global_step: Optional `Variable` to increment by one after the
		    variables have been updated.
		  var_list: Optional list or tuple of `Variable` objects to update to
		    minimize `loss`.  Defaults to the list of variables collected in
		    the graph under the key `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`.
		  gate_gradients: How to gate the computation of gradients.  Can be
		    `GATE_NONE`, `GATE_OP`, or  `GATE_GRAPH`.
		  aggregation_method: Specifies the method used to combine gradient terms.
		    Valid values are defined in the class `AggregationMethod`.
		  colocate_gradients_with_ops: If True, try colocating gradients with
		    the corresponding op.
		  name: Optional name for the returned operation.
		  grad_loss: Optional. A `Tensor` holding the gradient computed for `loss`.
		
		Returns:
		  An Operation that updates the variables in `var_list`.  If `global_step`
		  was not `None`, that operation also increments `global_step`.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If some of the variables are not `Variable` objects.
		
		@compatibility(eager)
		When eager execution is enabled, `loss` should be a Python function that
		takes no arguments and computes the value to be minimized. Minimization (and
		gradient computation) is done with respect to the elements of `var_list` if
		not None, else with respect to any trainable variables created during the
		execution of the `loss` function. `gate_gradients`, `aggregation_method`,
		`colocate_gradients_with_ops` and `grad_loss` are ignored when eager
		execution is enabled.
